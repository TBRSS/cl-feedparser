  &lt;a href="//what-if.xkcd.com/83/"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Star Sand&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p id="question"&gt;If you made a beach using grains the proportionate size of the stars in the Milky Way, what would that beach look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="attribute"&gt;Jeff Wartes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sand is interesting.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Citation needed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Are there more grains of sand than stars in the sky?&amp;quot; is a popular question which &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sand+grains+or+stars"&gt;has been tackled by many people&lt;/a&gt;. The upshot is that there are probably more stars in the visible universe than grains of sand on all of Earth&amp;#39;s beaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people do those calculations, they often dig up some good data on the number of stars, then do some hand-waving about sand grain size to come up with a number for the sand grains on Earth.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;From a practical point of view, geology and soil science are more complicated than astrophysics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; We&amp;#39;re not going to tackle that issue today, but to answer Jeff&amp;#39;s question, we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; need to figure out what the deal with sand is.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;&amp;quot;i like sand because i don&amp;#39;t really know what it is and there&amp;#39;s so many of it&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;—&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/darth__mouth/status/200707234840313856"&gt;@darth__mouth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Specifically, we need to have some idea of what grain sizes correspond to clay, silt, fine sand, coarse sand, and gravel, so we can understand how our galaxy would look and feel if it were a beach.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Instead of just containing a bunch of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2003/of03-001/htmldocs/images/chart.pdf"&gt;a wonderful chart&lt;/a&gt; by the US Geologic Survey that answers all these questions and more. For some reason, I find this chart very satisfying—it&amp;#39;s like the erosion geology edition of the electromagnetic spectrum chart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to surveys of sand,&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[4]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;There are apparently &lt;a href="http://www.fsbpa.com/05Proceedings/02-Don%20Stauble.pdf"&gt;lots&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/37337.pdf"&gt;them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the grains found on beaches tend to run from 0.2mm to 0.5mm (with the finest layers on top). This corresponds to medium-to-coarse sand in the chart. The individual grains are about this big:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="(sandisk)" src="/imgs/a/83/sand_sd.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we assume the Sun corresponds to a typical sand grain, then multiply by the number of stars in the galaxy, we come up with a large sandbox worth of sand.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[5]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;I mean, you come up with a bunch of numbers, but imagination turns them into a sandbox.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is wrong. The reason: Stars aren&amp;#39;t all the same size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of widely-circulated YouTube videos &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=star%20sizes"&gt;comparing star sizes&lt;/a&gt;. They do a good job of getting across just how staggeringly large some stars are. Although it&amp;#39;s easy to get lost in the videos and lose track of scale, it&amp;#39;s clear that some of the grains in our sandbox universe would be more like boulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how the main-sequence&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[6]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;The stars in the main part of their fuel-burning lifecycle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; star-sand grains look:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="These stars are all technically called &amp;#39;dwarf&amp;#39; stars. Astronomers could learn a thing or two about straightforward nomenclature from the sand-grain geologists." src="/imgs/a/83/sand_dwarfs.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They mostly fall into the &amp;quot;sand&amp;quot; category, though the larger Daft Punk stars cross the line into &amp;quot;granules&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;small pebbles&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that&amp;#39;s just the main sequence stars. Dying stars get much, much bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="They&amp;#39;re almost as big as SD cards!" src="/imgs/a/83/sand_red.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a star runs out of fuel, it expands into a red giant. Even ordinary stars can produce huge red giants, but when a star that&amp;#39;s already massive enters this phase, it can become a true monster. These red supergiants are the largest stars in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="I have a vague feeling that I shouldn&amp;#39;t be looking directly at this rock." src="/imgs/a/83/sand_hyper.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These beachball-sized sand stars would be rare, but the grape-sized and baseball-sized red giants are relatively common. While they&amp;#39;re not nearly as abundant as Sun-like stars or red dwarfs, their huge volume means that they&amp;#39;d constitute the bulk of our sand. We would have a large sandbox worth of grains ... along with a field of gravel that went on for miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="This beach sucks." src="/imgs/a/83/sand_gravel.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The little sand patch would contain 99% of the pile&amp;#39;s individual grains, but less than 1% of its total volume. Our Sun isn&amp;#39;t a grain of sand on a soft galactic beach; instead, the Milky Way is a field of boulders with some sand in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as with the real Earth seashore, it&amp;#39;s the rare little stretches of sand between the rocks where all the fun seems to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="Just to be clear, this image does not update every hour." src="/imgs/a/83/sand_castle.png"&gt;

  &lt;a href="//what-if.xkcd.com/82/"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hitting a comet&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p id="question"&gt;Astrophysicists are always saying things like &amp;quot;This mission to this comet is equivalent to throwing a baseball from New York and hitting a particular window in San Francisco.&amp;quot; Are they really equivalent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="attribute"&gt;Tom Foster&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No; the baseball thing is much harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="How are you even supposed to throw this thing?" src="/imgs/a/82/rosetta_baseball.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To throw something from New York to LA, you have to lob it out of the atmosphere like an ICBM.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Launched by New York at LA, as I&amp;#39;m sure happens now and then.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, baseballs are too small to punch through the atmosphere. No matter &lt;a href="http://what-if.xkcd.com/1/"&gt;how fast&lt;/a&gt; they&amp;#39;re going, they&amp;#39;ll wind up stopping before they make it to space. If you wanted to hit a window in LA with a baseball, you&amp;#39;d have better luck throwing it at a plane and hoping it gets lodged in the landing gear during takeoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comet-visiting spacecraft Tom&amp;#39;s astrophysicists are referring to is probably &lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta"&gt;Rosetta&lt;/a&gt;, which is about to orbit the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko and send a lander down to its surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko is a mouthful, so for the rest of this article I&amp;#39;m just going to call the comet &amp;quot;Kevin&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosetta is currently about to arrive at Kevin, and is about 780 million kilometers from Earth. It&amp;#39;s taken a roundabout route:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="Rosetta got gravitational assists from several flybys of Earth and one of Mars, flew past two asteroids, and—in a maneuver that still has some at ESA confused—became the first spacecraft to do a flyby of itself." src="/imgs/a/82/rosetta_route.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin, Rosetta&amp;#39;s target, is about 4 km wide. Since it&amp;#39;s 780 million kilometers away. If it were as far away as San Francisco is from New York, the target would be two centimeters wide—even more impressive than the statistic Tom quoted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Rosetta hitting its target is like throwing an object from New York and having it hit a particular key&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Tilde, if you&amp;#39;re curious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on a keyboard in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="I TOLD you to aim for SAVE!" src="/imgs/a/82/rosetta_send.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not a fair comparison, but you gotta admit, it sounds pretty precise. I once heard an account from someone who worked on the Cassini-Huygens mission, where one of the designers pointed out that their spacecraft traveled to a target a billion kilometers away, and arrived within something like a second and a half of the scheduled time.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Despite searching, I&amp;#39;ve been unable to track down this interview. If you see it, let me know!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we could make less flattering comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take remote surgery. If a surgeon in New York uses a remote surgery robot in San Francisco to do eye surgery, and the robot aims for the patient&amp;#39;s eye with the precision of Rosetta&amp;#39;s approach, it will point its laser somewhere around here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="At least it&amp;#39;ll help clear my sinuses." src="/imgs/a/82/rosetta_eye.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However this isn&amp;#39;t a fair comparison either. Both Rosetta and our laser surgeon&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[4]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;I really hope that&amp;#39;s what this job is called&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; will refine their movements as they make their final approaches, achieving very high precision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes down to it, the two tasks—remote surgery and remote probe-landing—are probably about equally precise, in a distance sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to something a little different with which I&amp;#39;d like to end this article: A question for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; to try to answer. Namely:&lt;blockquote&gt;Would you rather bet a million dollars on a spacecraft landing engineer&amp;#39;s ability to successfully perform eye surgery, or an eye surgeon&amp;#39;s ability to land a probe on a comet?&lt;/blockquote&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t been able to decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="But don&amp;#39;t worry; that&amp;#39;s a rare complication, only happening in one in every 20 or 30 procedures." src="/imgs/a/82/rosetta_surgery.png"&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

  &lt;a href="//what-if.xkcd.com/81/"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Catch!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p id="question"&gt;Is there any way to fire a gun so that the bullet flies through the air and can then be safely caught by hand? e.g. shooter is at sea level and catcher is up a mountain at the extreme range of the gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="attribute"&gt;Ed Hui, London&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;bullet catch&amp;quot; is a common magic trick in which a magician appears to catch a fired bullet in mid-flight—often between their teeth. This an illusion, of course; it&amp;#39;s not possible to catch a bullet like that.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;This was &lt;a href="http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/mythbusters-database/catch-bullet-teeth.htm"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Mythbusters&lt;/em&gt; in episode 4 of Season 4.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But under the right conditions, you could catch a bullet. It would just take a lot of patience.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to remind everyone that while I write sometimes about the interesting physics of bullets, I&amp;#39;m not an authority on firearms safety. I was raised &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quakers"&gt;Quaker&lt;/a&gt;; I&amp;#39;ve never held a gun, much less fired one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bullet fired straight up would eventually reach a maximum height.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Don&amp;#39;t do this. In neighborhoods where people fire guns upward in celebration, bystanders are &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/wk/mm5350.pdf"&gt;routinely killed&lt;/a&gt; by falling bullets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It probably wouldn&amp;#39;t stop completely; more likely, it would be drifting sideways at a couple meters per second. At that speed, as long as you were in the right place at the right time, you could snatch it out of the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone fired a bullet upward ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="Goodnight, Moon." src="/imgs/a/81/catch_up.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... and you were hanging out in a hot-air balloon directly above the firing range ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="Hmm. For every bullet I catch, I&amp;#39;ll need to drop a tiny sandbag." src="/imgs/a/81/catch_balloon.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; that you could reach out and snag the bullet at the apex of its flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you succeeded, you might notice something odd: In addition to being hot, the bullet would be spinning. It would have lost its upward momentum, but not its rotational momentum; it would still have the spin given to it by the barrel of the gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="(We&amp;#39;re in the northern hemisphere.)" src="/imgs/a/81/catch_spin.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This effect can be seen, dramatically, when a bullet is fired at ice.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[4]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Floor water.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; As confirmed by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bullet%20spinning%20ice"&gt;dozens of YouTube videos&lt;/a&gt; (and Mythbusters), bullets fired into ice are often found still spinning rapidly. You&amp;#39;d have to grab the bullet firmly; otherwise, it might jump out of your hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t have a balloon, you could potentially make this work from a mountain peak. Mount Thor, which you may remember from &lt;a href="http://what-if.xkcd.com/51/"&gt;question #51&lt;/a&gt;, features a vertical drop of 1,250 meters. According to ballistics lab Close Focus Research, this is almost exactly how high a .22 Long Rifle bullet will fly if fired directly upward.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[5]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Close Focus Research, &lt;a href="http://www.closefocusresearch.com/maximum-altitude-bullets-fired-vertically"&gt;Maximum Altitude For Bullets Fired Vertically&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="Oh, never mind, whoever was shooting just fell into the cotton candy pit." src="/imgs/a/81/catch_thor.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to use larger bullets, you&amp;#39;ll need a much larger drop; an AK-47&amp;#39;s bullet can go over two kilometers upward. There are no purely vertical cliffs that are that tall, so you&amp;#39;d need to fire the bullet at an angle, and it would have significant sideways speed at the top of its arc. However, a suitably tough baseball glove might be able to snag it.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[6]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;In fact, according to &lt;em&gt;Rifle Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, a gun writer &lt;a href="https://www.riflemagazine.com/magazine/article.cfm?magid=78&amp;amp;tocid=1094"&gt;once claimed&lt;/a&gt; that at a thousand yards, he could catch ordinary rifle bullets with a baseball glove. Of course, he was being figurative—you wouldn&amp;#39;t see the bullet coming, so you&amp;#39;d be just as likely to catch it with your face as with your glove.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any of these scenarios, you&amp;#39;d have to get extraordinarily lucky. Given the uncertainty in the bullet&amp;#39;s exact arc, you&amp;#39;d probably have to fire thousands of shots before catching one at exactly the right spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And by that point, you may find you&amp;#39;ve attracted some attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="He gave my scarecrow friend a prestigious degree that turned out to be TOTALLY USELESS for finding a job!" src="/imgs/a/81/catch_oz.png"&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

  &lt;a href="//what-if.xkcd.com/80/"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Pile of Viruses&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p id="question"&gt;What if every virus in the world were collected into one area? How much volume would they take up and what would they look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="attribute"&gt;Dave&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be a huge pile, but human viruses would make up only a tiny fraction of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, has killed tens of millions of people worldwide, and over 30 million people are currently living with HIV. The number of copies of the virus carried in someone&amp;#39;s blood can vary dramatically,&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Data on viral load—the number of copies of the virus per mL of blood—can be found in &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23196933"&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; but across all the people in the world, there probably exists about a spoonful worth of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="You should wash that spoon before you use it again." src="/imgs/a/80/virus_spoon.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The typical healthy human body contains about \(3 \times 10^{12}\) viruses. This is actually not as many as you might expect; by volume, humans are apparently a less friendly environment for viruses than, say, soil.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;An &lt;a href="http://www.rcn.montana.edu/pubs/pdf/2008/Srinivasiah%20Res%20%20Micro%202008.pdf"&gt;area of wetlands in Delaware&lt;/a&gt; contains something like four billion viruses per mL of soil, in case you were looking for a fun vacation destination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you gathered together all the viruses in all the humans in the world, they would fill about ten oil drums:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="So the world currently has about a 200,000,000,000:1 oil reserve:human virus ratio. I&amp;#39;m sure this number has some economic significance." src="/imgs/a/80/virus_oil.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These 10 barrels only represent a tiny portion of the global virus community. Most of the world&amp;#39;s viruses aren&amp;#39;t found in humans. They&amp;#39;re found in the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seawater is full of microorganisms, and we&amp;#39;ve recently learned that those microorganisms are preyed on by viruses in a big way. Every day, about one in five living cells in the ocean is killed by a virus.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uni-due.de/imperia/md/content/water-science/ws0910/2031b_02z_ws0910_suttle_marine_viruses.pdf"&gt;Marine viruses—major players in the global ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These viruses are found from the surface of the ocean down to the depths.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[4]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Oddly, as you go further offshore and further down, the concentration of viruses doesn&amp;#39;t decrease as much as the concentration of bacteria, so the virus-to-bacteria ratio is higher in the deep oceans than near the shore. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Because the sea is so big,&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[5]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Citation: Go and look at the sea. It&amp;#39;s big.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; it contains a staggering number of viruses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you piled up all these viruses—more than 10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; of them—in one place, they would be the size of a small mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="It would be a little smaller than Mount Royal in Montreal." src="/imgs/a/80/virus_mountain.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to say exactly what the virus mountain would look like, but it would probably resemble something in between pus and meat slurry.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[6]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Blame Dave—he&amp;#39;s the one who asked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Regardless of its exact appearance, it would almost certainly be disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="The CDC recommends that to avoid infection, you should pour globs of pure virus into the crook of your arm instead of directly onto your hand." src="/imgs/a/80/virus_hand.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pile wouldn&amp;#39;t stay mountain-shaped for long, any more than a mountain of any organic secretion would.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[7]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t believe me, try building a mountain of earwax or snot. You&amp;#39;ll find you can&amp;#39;t make it higher than a few inches before your friends and family show up and sit you down for a talk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To avoid a gigantic flood, it might be better to collect them into some kind of container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MetLife Stadium, host of Super Bowl XLVIII, has a volume of about 1.5 million cubic meters. Earth&amp;#39;s viruses could fill the stadium about 150 times over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you watch the Super Bowl, take a moment to picture all the players floating, suspended, in a sea of yellowish-white secretions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the game!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a href="//what-if.xkcd.com/79/"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Lake Tea&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p id="question"&gt;What if we were to dump all the tea in the world into the Great Lakes? How strong, compared to a regular cup of tea, would the lake tea be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="attribute"&gt;Alex Burman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weak, bordering on homeopathic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard cup of tea, as described by the International Organization for Standardization in &lt;a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=8250"&gt;ISO 3103&lt;/a&gt;, contains two grams of tea per 100 mL of water.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[1]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Further ISO standards concerning tea include &lt;a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=51541"&gt;ISO 3720&lt;/a&gt; (black tea), &lt;a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=51540"&gt;ISO 11287&lt;/a&gt; (green tea), and &lt;a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=31357"&gt;ISO 14502-2&lt;/a&gt; (the difference between black tea and green tea).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The Great Lakes have a volume of about 22,600 cubic kilometers, which means we would need about 450 billion tons of tea to reach proper strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Tea Board of India, one year&amp;#39;s global tea harvest totals only about 4.8 &lt;em&gt;million&lt;/em&gt; tons,&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[2]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Using figures from &lt;a href="http://www.teaboard.gov.in/pdf/Tea%20Statistics%20Global%20Scenario.pdf"&gt;this report&lt;/a&gt; extrapolated forward to 2014.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; only 1/100,000th of what we&amp;#39;d require to make Great Lake Tea. If we dumped those 4.8 million tons into the lakes, the resulting tea would be about as strong as if we&amp;#39;d dripped two drops of tea in a bathtub.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[3]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Technically, calling this kind of tea &amp;quot;homeopathic&amp;quot; is an exaggeration, since substances in homeopathy are diluted &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more than this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Proper bathtub tea, of course, requires one 3-kg bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="Cue strong opinions about adding sugar to bathtubs." src="/imgs/a/79/tea_bathtub.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For better lake tea, we should find a lake with a volume of 240 million cubic meters (0.24 cubic kilometers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wular Lake&lt;/strong&gt; in Kashmir is one candidate. Its volume varies with the seasons, but during the winter it&amp;#39;s just about exactly the right size.&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[4]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Unfortunately, it&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://www.ramsar.org/pdf/wurc/wurc_mgtplan_india_wular.pdf"&gt;shrinking&lt;/a&gt;. (For winter volume, see the chart on page 18 of that report.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; India is the world&amp;#39;s second-largest tea producer, so it&amp;#39;s also conveniently located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ullswater&lt;/strong&gt;, in the UK&amp;#39;s Lake District, is another great candidate. With a relatively stable year-round volume of about 0.23 cubic kilometers, it would be an excellent site for brewing a global cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, while neither Wular Lake or Ullswater has ever been used as a giant teakettle, something like this was—famously—attempted in my own backyard in Boston. In 1773, a group of colonists disguised as American Indians&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[5]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;They dressed up as American Indians to align themselves politically with the Americas—against Britain—invoking the popular European stereotype of the free and noble savage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mohawk people, the actual Indians who the protesters were mimicking, mistrusted the settlers encroaching on their land, sided with the British during the subsequent war, and afterward were driven from their homes by the Americans and fled to Canada.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; boarded three British ships and threw the cargo of tea—around 44 tons of it—into Boston Harbor to protest British-run tax policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boston Harbor has a volume of about 0.44 cubic kilometers, which means that the &amp;quot;tea&amp;quot; brewed in 1773 would have been even more dilute than our Great Lakes tea. The harbor is also somewhat larger&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[6]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;The tidal range in Boston is so large (over three meters) that the harbor&amp;#39;s volume at high tide is nearly double what it is at low.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; than Wular Lake or Ullswater, so all the tea in the world would still make Boston Harbor slightly too weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="Although it&amp;#39;s a lot better since we built that treatment plant and stopped dumping all our raw sewage in." src="/imgs/a/79/tea_harbor.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s another problem: Heat. If you wanted to make tea from a lake, such as Ullswater or Wular Lake, you&amp;#39;d have to heat the water up. Is that even possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s clearly enough stored energy in the world to do it. After all, we presumably heat that amount of water for tea every year already; we just do it in small batches around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To heat up Ullswater to 80°C&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[7]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Lots of people have very strong opinions on what this temperature should be. Please direct any corrections on this matter to &lt;em&gt;What-If Tea-Related Complaints Dep&amp;#39;t, c/o Her Majesty The Queen, Buckingham Palace, London SW1A 1AA&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; would take \(6.6 \times 10^{16}\) joules of energy—about 20 days worth of British electricity consumption. which is roughly what would be released if you dropped a water bottle full of antimatter in the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="Not a significant source of riboflavin." src="/imgs/a/79/tea_waterbottle.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking Britain to go without electricity for 20 days just to fill one of their lakes with tea seems like it might be a hard sell. Fortunately, there&amp;#39;s an easier solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boiling Lake&lt;/strong&gt; in Dominica is a volcanic lake about 60 meters across. Its temperature varies, but it&amp;#39;s often near boiling at the edges and vigorously boiling in the center. Measuring the depth of the lake is difficult, so it&amp;#39;s hard to get an estimate of the total volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="The fact that it seems to boil away sometimes doesn&amp;#39;t help." src="/imgs/a/79/tea_boiling.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frying Pan Lake&lt;/strong&gt; in New Zealand, on the other hand, is the largest hot lake in the world. It has a volume of about 200,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and an average temperature of around 50°C—not quite hot enough for tea, but much closer than Ullswater or Wular Lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealanders consume about 600 grams of tea per person,&lt;span class="ref"&gt;&lt;span class="refnum"&gt;[8]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="refbody"&gt;Kerryn Pollock. &amp;#39;&lt;a href="http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/tea-coffee-and-soft-drinks"&gt;Tea, coffee and soft drinks&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;, Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 15-Jul-13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for a total of 2,700 tons of tea. If they waited until Frying Pan Lake got particularly hot, then dunked it all in at once ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class="illustration" title="We are making a good decision by doing this thing we read on a blog. We are going to have so much tea." src="/imgs/a/79/tea_nz.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... they could brew a year&amp;#39;s worth of tea in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
