I&amp;#039;m in a good position to answer this question, having seen the dramatic changes when lifestyle is upgraded over generations in an entire country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My grandparents, children at that time, escaped from the newly formed Pakistan from furious mobs killing masses of people in 1947. They saw everything they owned disappear within seconds in flames and their relatives stabbed to death. They barely made it to India, with almost nothing except some gold jewellery, and a primary education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My grandad started as a daily wage laborer, then a security guard, and finally a police officer. He would study law when he was 40 with 5 children to support. Through sheer willpower, he managed to educate them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Dad started working with a small, regular income as an engineer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I arrived the year the New Economic Policy was introduced in India, and globalization followed. Suddenly a new generation of Indians leading 1st world lifestyles arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, there have been&amp;nbsp; problems at home dealing with this change. It took me a course in management to realize that &lt;b&gt;Maslow&amp;#039;s Hierarchy&lt;/b&gt; wonderfully explains the behavior across generations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="qtext_image zoomable_in zoomable_in_feed" src="http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7af4438a34c9699a1ab7a9c7142a0302" master_src="http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-807b5aa5ed248b70ca6e8e69411bcb2e" master_w="800" master_h="600"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;I realized that my grandad grew up in Tier 2 (safety). My dad in Tier 3 and 4 (love, belonging, esteem). And me in Tier 5 (self-actualization).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what we experience in our youth, tends to stick to us always. So there&amp;#039;s always friction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;School, to my dad, is all about studies. He had to be the topper, and work hard all the time. That&amp;#039;s how it was in his time. Fast forward to my school, where there was a strong social hierarchy, and everyone wanted to be the coolest kid. &lt;b&gt;Security of employment &lt;/b&gt;is no longer the aim, &lt;b&gt;self-esteem&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;respect of others&lt;/b&gt; was the aim. And of course, he didn&amp;#039;t understand it, which led to fights. I couldn&amp;#039;t go to school trips, couldn&amp;#039;t get branded clothes, or couldn&amp;#039;t party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My grandfather is staunchly religious. My dad is spiritual, but not religious. I&amp;#039;m an atheist. My grandfather would never even talk to a Muslim, my dad strongly dislikes them, and I argue with my Dad how mob mentality has got nothing to do with religion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I long to go out, travel and have adventures. My Dad would only approve of it if there&amp;#039;s enough money. My grandad would call me a lunatic idiot and never allow it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Grandad scans the newspaper only to comment, &amp;quot;China is going to attack us one day. And this country will go down.&amp;quot; My dad scans the newspaper and worries about inflation and corruption. I scan the newspaper and grow outrageous on hearing countries spying on their own citizens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I had a huge argument with my dad over morality. I argued that just because someone is a murderer doesn&amp;#039;t always mean he should be punished. He disagreed, and felt that a murderer is a murderer, end of story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Grandad lives in an apartment smaller than my room, and he&amp;#039;s satisfied with it. He just has the basic necessities, and feels anything extra is an utter waste of money. I grow sullen when my smartphone turns two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;My Grandad&amp;#039;s greatest worry is to see all that he built break up. My Dad&amp;#039;s greatest worry is not having enough savings for his family. My greatest worry is being stuck in a routine lifestyle, with the same old people in the same old job.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brands&amp;nbsp; matter when you just become rich. You&amp;#039;ve got to show you&amp;#039;re rich (see Tier 4). The Starbucks that recently opened in New Delhi had a line half a kilometer&amp;nbsp; long. No one cared about the coffee. It was all about the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maslow&amp;#039;s Hierarchy can so so strongly predict these behaviors that it often leaves me amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an example of a generation getting richer faster than that in India or China, look over to Dubai. I bet they&amp;#039;ll have even more interesting stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;EDIT:&lt;/b&gt; As someone mentioned, a 1st world style living in a 3rd world country is very different from living in a 1st world country. We see poverty around in droves. We don&amp;#039;t have &amp;quot;social security&amp;quot;. We&amp;#039;re never able to shake off the feeling that everything we possess could be lost in a moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Life/How-will-people-react-to-moving-from-a-low-to-a-high-standard-of-living"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">5:b7c900f10b39d4f7bbf4ecb745b03a73#1373489377251549</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2013 20:49:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What is the craziest thing you have ever said (or done) at an interview and still got the job ?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/Job-Interviews/What-is-the-craziest-thing-you-have-ever-said-or-done-at-an-interview-and-still-got-the-job/answer/Richard-Waddington</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In Job Interviews: Samuel Clay voted up an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_214"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_Mjikovf_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_Mjikovf_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/Richard-Waddington" routing="q://user/(15631039)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_Mjikovf_link"&gt;Richard Waddington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been with the same company for over a decade and decided it was time to move on, so this was my first job interview in a very long time.&amp;nbsp; I was more than a little stressed out about it...&amp;nbsp; Suit? Cleaned and pressed.&amp;nbsp; Tie? Tied and straight.&amp;nbsp; Shoes shined.&amp;nbsp; Socks match.&amp;nbsp; Ok, time to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&amp;#039;m heading out the door, my daughter (who was about 4 at the time) rushed up and said &amp;quot;Daddy, take this for good luck!&amp;quot; and handed me a little plastic cow from a barnyard play set.&amp;nbsp; I gave her a big hug, and rushed off, hoping I wouldn&amp;#039;t be late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several hours of being poked and prodded technically, and feeling pretty good about it, I&amp;#039;m sitting across from the VP of HR, a middle aged woman wearing a conservative suit, who says &amp;quot;I&amp;#039;ve heard good things from the interview team, but I do have one concern...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uh oh...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;...You look like a pretty straight-laced guy, and, well, things get a little crazy here from time to time.&amp;nbsp; How do I know you&amp;#039;ll fit in?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without thinking I blurted out, &amp;quot;I have a cow in my pocket!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a moment of very awkward silence, and I was convinced I&amp;#039;d just blown it, but I found the cow, and set it on the table.&amp;nbsp; Another second or two went by before she burst out laughing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Job-Interviews/What-is-the-craziest-thing-you-have-ever-said-or-done-at-an-interview-and-still-got-the-job"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">5:9ceacc7c32e005f1221c6bd0539f0a32#1371580607475871</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2013 18:36:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Samuel Clay followed Brittany Morgan.</title><link>http://www.quora.com/Brittany-Morgan-2</link><description></description><guid isPermaLink="false">4:4b91af130637cc9be2a7eb0f10b099ba#1370481494590472</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2013 01:18:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Samuel Clay followed Jodi Kantor.</title><link>http://www.quora.com/Jodi-Kantor-1</link><description></description><guid isPermaLink="false">4:3610a10e655f17d87e36152222fbcf93#1368049774794739</guid><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2013 21:49:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What is the single most illuminating question I can ask someone?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/Interpersonal-Interaction/What-is-the-single-most-illuminating-question-I-can-ask-someone/answer/Jodi-Kantor-1</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In Interpersonal Interaction: Samuel Clay promoted an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_215"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_zusQLfC_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_zusQLfC_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/Jodi-Kantor-1" routing="q://user/(12632887)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_zusQLfC_link"&gt;Jodi Kantor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#039;m a reporter at the NY Times, I write about and often interview powerful people for a living, and I strongly believe the answer is: there is no one question that works for everyone. In fact, the secret to asking great questions is avoiding generalities or broad philosophical inquiries. Hypotheticals are worst of all, because they&amp;#039;re going to give you the opposite of what you want, which is the person&amp;#039;s real, lived experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To ask a really high-yielding question, you need to have done your homework. In my experience, the kinds of general questions named above don&amp;#039;t work very well. (Does anyone have a truly dazzling answer to the old &amp;quot;if you could meet anyone, living or dead?&amp;quot;) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most illuminating questions are simple and specific. In the fall of 2009, I interviewed President and First Lady Barack and Michelle Obama about their marriage. My goal was to get them to avoid soundbites, to give honest, unrehearsed answers, and because I had been reporting on them for over two years at that point, I knew what to avoid and where to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had come to understand that equality was a serious issue in the Obama marriage, and that in the White House, the president and first lady are not treated in the same way at all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I summoned up my nerve and asked them, &amp;quot;How do you have an equal marriage when one person is president?&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first lady immediately made a sound like &amp;quot;hah!&amp;quot; as if she was glad someone was finally asking that question. And then she did something very smart: she let her husband answer the question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He tried. Barack Obama is normally so eloquent, but he botched his reply three times, stopping and starting over. It was such a hard question to answer-- Michelle Obama had been his supervisor at the law firm where they met, and yet she had made sacrifice after sacrifice for him, and now they were living in a world where he was like the sun, with everyone else rotating around him. Finally on the fourth try he half-joked that his staff was more concerned with satisfying the first lady than satisfying him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Michelle Obama stepped in to rescue him, giving the obvious politic answer: they were equals in their private lives if not in their public lives. The whole exchange was incredibly illuminating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you don&amp;#039;t have years to research your subject, and it&amp;#039;s a situation like a job interview where you&amp;#039;re trying to assess someone, I would avoid sweeping statements, because they are likely to produce mush. For instance, when I hired a babysitter for my daughter, I used the same interviewing techniques I do in reporting and made the questions as concrete as possible: &amp;quot;Were you looking after a child on 9/11 and how did you react to the emergency?&amp;quot; (This was NYC in 2006 so the question made sense.) Also &amp;quot;what&amp;#039;s a good lunch for a toddler?&amp;quot; The sitters who said nuggets and fries were out; the one who said she was a vegetarian who would be happy to cook healthy food is still working for us seven years later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck. Oh, and if you&amp;#039;re interested in the Obamas&amp;#039; behind the scenes adjustment to the White House, my book has much more on the topic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Interpersonal-Interaction/What-is-the-single-most-illuminating-question-I-can-ask-someone"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">5:de9762c4f1bdf256c5c8503606b60e97#1368049770557197</guid><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2013 21:49:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What is the single most illuminating question I can ask someone?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/Interpersonal-Interaction/What-is-the-single-most-illuminating-question-I-can-ask-someone/answer/Jodi-Kantor-1</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In Interpersonal Interaction: Samuel Clay voted up an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_216"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_AeHhgI4_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_AeHhgI4_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/Jodi-Kantor-1" routing="q://user/(12632887)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_AeHhgI4_link"&gt;Jodi Kantor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#039;m a reporter at the NY Times, I write about and often interview powerful people for a living, and I strongly believe the answer is: there is no one question that works for everyone.

The overarching idea behind this answer is a form of metacognition, or in other words, cognition about cognition, exemplified by my personal brand of Theory of Mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. &lt;b&gt;Introspection&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Introspection is one of the most fundamental necessities of trying to understand who you are and what your place in the world is. It should be necessary to everyone to explain to themselves in a satisfactory manner a) why they believe in what they believe b) is there a possibility of them being completely and utterly wrong in their conclusions. In addition, being able to examine your own internal process from a non-involved vantage point while it&amp;#039;s happening is extremely helpful in creating a complete idea of your self-identity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wikipedia: &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection" class="external_link" target="_blank" onmouseover="return require(&amp;quot;qtext&amp;quot;).tooltip(this, &amp;quot;wikipedia.org&amp;quot;)"&gt;Introspection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. &lt;b&gt;A Sense of Internal Pluralism&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mental landscape of the human mind is not a singular thing, it can be best described as a debate by an inconsistent committee of contradictory opinions. I dare say that most people don&amp;#039;t realize that they have more than one internal voice, especially since it&amp;#039;s considerably easier to go along with the conclusion of the most vocal one at any given time. Just recognizing the fact that you do indeed have, as it were, an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other, helps to give you a sense of who you really are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for clarification, I&amp;#039;m not talking about hearing voices. I&amp;#039;m talking about the fact that there are different parts in a person&amp;#039;s mental make-up, otherwise there wouldn&amp;#039;t be much sense in the idiom &amp;quot;to argue with oneself&amp;quot; or in the concept of self-doubt. The non-involved vantage point that I mentioned earlier basically means that a part of you notices when you&amp;#039;re arguing with yourself, and can observe the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. &lt;b&gt;Solipsism&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For any of this to make sense, every adult person should have a satisfactory rational explanation as to why they can say that an external world beyond their own internal world exists in the first place. Without having done so, one&amp;#039;s opinions on the external world seem rather pointless to begin with, so it is an essential foundation to build everything else on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wikipedia: &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism" class="external_link" target="_blank" onmouseover="return require(&amp;quot;qtext&amp;quot;).tooltip(this, &amp;quot;wikipedia.org&amp;quot;)"&gt;Solipsism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. &lt;b&gt;Fundamental Attribution Error / Introspection Illusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We humans tend to trust our own introspection to a greater extent than that of anyone else, because we have no direct means of observing the latter. What this really means is that we tend to evaluate our own actions based on our underlying internal motives, and everybody else&amp;#039;s based on the consequences of their actions. The net effect of this can be devastating, as thinking along these lines makes it impossible for us to appreciate the internal motives of anyone else. To give a prosaic example: if you slip on, say, a wet surface, you&amp;#039;d think to yourself &amp;quot;it wasn&amp;#039;t my fault that I slipped, the conditions were surprising and unfavorable&amp;quot; but someone observing the incident might simply think &amp;quot;whoa, that dude is really clumsy&amp;quot;. When you extend this to a confrontational situation, you end up with some of the bloodiest conflicts possible; people only realize their own justifiable motivations for aggression, misunderstanding or simply not caring about those of of the opposing party. This results in rhetoric like &amp;quot;we are simply trying to defend ourselves from an external threat (own internal introspection), which was originally instigated by Those Evil People because they&amp;#039;re a bunch of Really Nasty Bastards (simplification of introspection of other party)&amp;quot;. The results of this kind of thinking can be seen in every genocide that has ever befallen our species, because just observing the consequences makes it a lot easier to label someone evil. This mode of thought is endemic to being human, but at least you should have a mental warning signal going off in your head when you notice yourself doing something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more example to illustrate the point; you lend your car to a friend, who ends up accidentally crashing it. He/she&amp;#039;ll be saying how sorry they are and how they didn&amp;#039;t mean it, but you&amp;#039;ll still be angry, because f**k, you crashed my car. If the situation were reversed, you&amp;#039;d be exhorting how you didn&amp;#039;t mean to do it, but the person from whom you lent the car would be pissed off, maybe even more so because of your &amp;#039;excuses&amp;#039;, and you&amp;#039;d wonder why he couldn&amp;#039;t relent even a bit, because you really didn&amp;#039;t mean to do it. The reason is quite simply because your explanation has to do with your motives, but his/her perspective is based solely on the consequences. You have fundamentally two completely different perspectives in that given exchange. Sounds quite familiar when put like that, doesn&amp;#039;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A strongly related concept is that of cognitive biases: &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases" class="external_link" target="_blank" onmouseover="return require(&amp;quot;qtext&amp;quot;).tooltip(this, &amp;quot;wikipedia.org&amp;quot;)"&gt;List of cognitive biases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. &lt;b&gt;Relativism&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you start with introspection, and realize the possible fallacy that you&amp;#039;re unwittingly committing by downplaying those of other people, you quickly run into the possibility that everything you think and believe might be utterly and completely wrong, or at least not as absolute as you previously thought. This usually results in either taking a healthier perspective regarding your own opinions or a full-blown existential crisis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wikipedia: &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativism" class="external_link" target="_blank" onmouseover="return require(&amp;quot;qtext&amp;quot;).tooltip(this, &amp;quot;wikipedia.org&amp;quot;)"&gt;Relativism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. &lt;b&gt;Existentialism&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine once said that you can&amp;#039;t really call yourself an adult before having dealt with the idea of existentialism, and I agree completely. We humans have an unbelievable knack to ignore the abyss beneath the thin shell of our own psyche, and that can lead to acting out of sheer ignorance. What I mean by this is that if you never even give a moment&amp;#039;s thought to the possibility that there are no absolute truths in anything, or worse yet, you get scared by the very notion of it and avoid the issue, you tend to cling to things which proclaim to be absolute truths. This is nothing short of sticking your head to the sand until the nasty thing goes away, and you&amp;#039;re just as likely to get bitten in the ass if you do so. The Nietzschean version has been over-publicized to some extent, not giving enough room for various other thinkers. My personal favorite is a Norwegian philosopher by the name of Peter Wessel Zapffe, whose essay &amp;quot;The Last Messiah&amp;quot; encapsulates the concept of existentialism in a slightly &amp;quot;healthier&amp;quot; way than Nietzsche&amp;#039;s body of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wikipedia: &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism" class="external_link" target="_blank" onmouseover="return require(&amp;quot;qtext&amp;quot;).tooltip(this, &amp;quot;wikipedia.org&amp;quot;)"&gt;Existentialism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nietzsche: &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nietzsche#Philosophy" class="external_link" target="_blank" onmouseover="return require(&amp;quot;qtext&amp;quot;).tooltip(this, &amp;quot;wikipedia.org&amp;quot;)"&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zapffe: &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Wessel_Zapffe" class="external_link" target="_blank" onmouseover="return require(&amp;quot;qtext&amp;quot;).tooltip(this, &amp;quot;wikipedia.org&amp;quot;)"&gt;Peter Wessel Zapffe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; / &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://scratchpad.wikia.com/wiki/The_Last_Messiah" rel="nofollow" class="external_link" target="_blank" onmouseover="return require(&amp;quot;qtext&amp;quot;).tooltip(this, &amp;quot;wikia.com&amp;quot;)"&gt;The Last Messiah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. &lt;b&gt;Epicureanism&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epicurus was a rather amazing Greek philosopher, who, through sheer logic, could come to such fundamental conclusions that it took almost 2200 years for science to develop to prove them correct. The basic idea of Epicureanism can be encapsulated by the Tetrapharmakon: Don&amp;#039;t fear god, don&amp;#039;t fear death, what is good is easy to get and pain is easy to endure. Especially in light of the existential fear of death that we as human being tend to generally share, the idea is very simple: when you&amp;#039;re alive, you&amp;#039;re alive, so thinking about your own death is premature and pointless, and when you&amp;#039;re dead, you tend to be too busy being dead to notice it at all. A lot of Epicureanism can be seen as a precursor of the aforementioned existentialism, which he, again, predated by more than 2000 years. Epicurus was highly influential in the imperial Roman period, but the Catholic church did an excellent job in getting pretty much everybody to either forget or completely misunderstand the school of thought, as it was in some respects diametrically opposed to certain tenets of the Catholic faith (especially the relativism inherent in Epicureanism doesn&amp;#039;t really work with any strictly dogmatical system of belief).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My choosing Epicureanism as an example serves to illustrate another point, which in all honesty would merit its own section in this answer. The point is essentially that a lot of the philosophical views we hold to be unique to this day and age are essentially the rehashing of old ideas. The inherent implication of this is that seemingly new philosophical ideas do not effectuate change, as most of them aren&amp;#039;t actually new. So, the reason why people&amp;#039;s view on the world changes, along with the general views and values in a societal context, are better described by other processes than that of ideological development. One view (prominently expounded by Hegel) on the matter is that society and its values change according to the relations of power of different societal groups. That is to say: democracy, egality, rule of law, humanitarianism etc. are prominent values today because they fundamentally serve the interests of the dominant parts of (at least Western) society. The conclusion of all this is that our society is certainly descriptively different from that of yesteryear, but it&amp;#039;s considered a fallacy to say that we&amp;#039;ve objectively evolved to some sort of better form of society along the ages, because we anachronistically evaluate previous societies through our current value system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wikipedia: &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicureanism" class="external_link" target="_blank" onmouseover="return require(&amp;quot;qtext&amp;quot;).tooltip(this, &amp;quot;wikipedia.org&amp;quot;)"&gt;Epicureanism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. &lt;b&gt;Logical fallacies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially in a democratic society, one should always have a critical mind regarding statements given by someone promoting any given solution or opinion. Logical fallacies, both formal and informal, are used as much today as they were in ancient Greece or Rome, where they were first codified. Just being able to spot a post hoc ergo propter hoc-argument or understanding the concept of onus probandi will give you a better view into the rationality of the opinions and arguments of others. This is simple enough with external views and opinions, but the really hard part is to apply the same rigorous and stringent standards to your own thinking. This is a part of the introspection mentioned in the beginning; to be able to do that properly means that you notice when you&amp;#039;re taking the easy and intellectually dishonest way in an argument, and to preferably decide not to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wikipedia: &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_fallacies" class="external_link" target="_blank" onmouseover="return require(&amp;quot;qtext&amp;quot;).tooltip(this, &amp;quot;wikipedia.org&amp;quot;)"&gt;Fallacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. &lt;b&gt;Hume&amp;#039;s Guillotine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be it due to lack of wont or that of capability, distinguishing between normative and descriptive statements is something people normally don&amp;#039;t really do properly. This is the origin of a lot of rather awful argumentation, because people mix what ought to be and what actually is. This is important, because to be able to say that &amp;quot;this is the situation, it would be better if it were so&amp;quot; implies that you have an underlying rationale to evaluate the current situation and how the suggestion you&amp;#039;re making would make it better. This further implies being able to understand the rationale behind how you formulate opinions in the first place, which requires introspective understanding of oneself on a level that a lot of people really can&amp;#039;t be bothered with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wikipedia: &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hume%27s_Guillotine" class="external_link" target="_blank" onmouseover="return require(&amp;quot;qtext&amp;quot;).tooltip(this, &amp;quot;wikipedia.org&amp;quot;)"&gt;Is–ought problem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. &lt;b&gt;Utilitarianism&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeremy Bentham, at least to me, was one of the greatest thinkers ever to have lived. His concept of utilitarianism gives a strong teleological argument how to evaluate and formulate normative statements, which is simply: maximize utility (i.e. as much good as possible for as many people as possible). This idea underlies all modern economics, and it is one way to answer the dilemma posed by Hume&amp;#039;s guillotine. One should however understand that increased utility doesn&amp;#039;t necessarily mean &amp;quot;more money&amp;quot;, otherwise it&amp;#039;ll be quite difficult to understand a lot of how the world actually works. In some ways, the forerunner of utilitarianism was, yet again, Epicurus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wikipedia: &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism" class="external_link" target="_blank" onmouseover="return require(&amp;quot;qtext&amp;quot;).tooltip(this, &amp;quot;wikipedia.org&amp;quot;)"&gt;Utilitarianism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(11.) The aim of all this is creating a logically consistent self-identity.&lt;br /&gt;The point of pondering the aforementioned questions and finding a satisfactory personal answer to them is to link your thoughts and opinions (and the rationale behind them), be they philosophical, religious or political, into an internally consistent framework, which helps you deal with new questions and ideas and gives you a means to overcome the sense of cosmic terror that all people suffer from, but which most subconsciously ignore. After having done all this, you&amp;#039;ll pretty much know exactly who you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A strongly related concept: &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition" class="external_link" target="_blank" onmouseover="return require(&amp;quot;qtext&amp;quot;).tooltip(this, &amp;quot;wikipedia.org&amp;quot;)"&gt;Metacognition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Philosophy/What-are-the-top-10-philosophical-ideas-that-everyone-should-understand"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">5:9c6e9ec80526316e776c79791ca8b26c#1365798896713721</guid><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2013 20:34:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>How many times does an RSS feed publish content each day?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/RSS-1/How-many-times-does-an-RSS-feed-publish-content-each-day/answer/Samuel-Clay</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In RSS: Samuel Clay added an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_219"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_LknlNOQ_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_LknlNOQ_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/Samuel-Clay" routing="q://user/(12196)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_LknlNOQ_link"&gt;Samuel Clay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can easily find this information by subscribing to the feed in NewsBlur and going to Statistics (right-click on the feed title).

The other interns were all from CMU, MIT, Stanford, and every other big name school, and I went to Ohio State. &amp;quot;Pedigreed&amp;quot; would be an apt description for my peers, and I was intimidated. Everyone was really smart, and I didn&amp;#039;t think I&amp;#039;d measure up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I just put my head down and worked my ass off. And by the end of that summer I was the only intern billing hours to clients.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#039;ve never looked back since. What I&amp;#039;ve come to realize is that all the top companies have interview processes that, while flawed, are geared towards false negatives, because the negative impact of a bad hire is so high. Many of these companies also look at school name as well, so if you got an offer, you should be reassured by the idea that you did very well at your interviews. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember that having a degree from a fancy school says much more about a person when they were 18 and applying to college than it says about how they stand today. With a few exceptions (Caltech kids seemed the smartest by FAR, but somewhat jaded by the experience), the hardest part about getting a degree at a top school is getting in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#039;m not saying that Stanford and CMU kids aren&amp;#039;t smart- they certainly are. Trilogy&amp;#039;s admissions process was grueling and I met some of the smartest people I&amp;#039;ve ever known there, and they were certainly smarter than the average students at my school, but here&amp;#039;s the thing- they were probably above average at their own schools as well. Realizing that I could hold my own in that environment helped my confidence immensely, and having Trilogy on my resume helped me much more than any fancy name on my diploma. Trilogy gave me a big break and I made the most of it. I&amp;#039;d advise you to do the same, I&amp;#039;m sure you&amp;#039;ll realize that you&amp;#039;re a giant slayer yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Software-Engineering/I-have-been-offered-employment-in-one-of-the-hardest-to-get-into-companies-in-the-world-I-am-afraid-I-might-not-be-up-to-the-task-What-should-I-do"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">5:ea3a7125c6cd096c78d2c43a36210f24#1364323427574877</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Mar 2013 18:43:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Is economic growth sustainable?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/Economics/Is-economic-growth-sustainable/answer/David-Galbraith</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In Economics: Samuel Clay voted up an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_221"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_eweXgfp_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_eweXgfp_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/David-Galbraith" routing="q://user/(127285)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_eweXgfp_link"&gt;David Galbraith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only with an information economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Economic growth, population growth, progress and wellbeing correlates strongly with the amount of cheaply available energy humans have. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is much of this being depleted but even if it were in unlimited supply, continuing use of it will threaten our existence through climate change and ecological damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, systems geared around economic growth which consume more energy will eventually destroy themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, growing economies will become richer and wipe out purely sustainable (non growing) ones, partly because we are territorial animals that will always build the best weapons that we can afford and partly because growth is a function of competition for resources that is part of the arms race of natural selection itself. However, this does not mean that energy depleting economies will survive their own waste or that partially sustainable, growing economies will be wiped out by being non-competitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, systems geared around pursuit of economic growth are inevitable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way to avoid us inevitably destroying our finite world is to either grow the size of the system (colonize other planets etc. Good luck with that!) or to increase efficiency and still grow economically (continue growth but with the same energy use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Increasing efficiency when it comes to physical things is very difficult, because it requires conscious effort against the natural order of things which is to make waste as a by product of creation. We are all little entropy machines, governed by the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics. We are biologically impelled to maximize waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily the 2nd Law applies to information as well as steam engines, and it turns out that there is a vast amount of potential information in a small amount of a physical thing like steam. The energy per bit of digital media is potentially millions of times less than a physical media. A library can fit on a thumb sized disk. We can still make a creative mess without wasting energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Economic growth is sustainable if we continue to switch from an industrial economy to an information (services) based one, where consumption growth is of bits of information and physical things such as people, food and shelter are born, grown and built sustainably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Economics/Is-economic-growth-sustainable"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">5:35853653062e27a351ec9caf4d523fce#1362598612173844</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2013 19:36:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Why do so many writers use words that might be difficult for some readers?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/Writing/Why-do-so-many-writers-use-words-that-might-be-difficult-for-some-readers/answer/Laura-Copeland</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In Writing: Samuel Clay voted up an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_222"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_EOtwJ3s_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_EOtwJ3s_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/Laura-Copeland" routing="q://user/(35898)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_EOtwJ3s_link"&gt;Laura Copeland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Say you&amp;#039;re hosting a dinner party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moments before your guests are due to arrive, you&amp;#039;re putting the finishing touches on a fine-looking platter of bruschetta.

And you&amp;#039;re not even entirely sure you have a shallot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, you ditch the tomatoes and swap them for strawberries, pulling from a chopped bunch reserved for dessert. You scoop a dollop of ricotta from a tub in the refrigerator and spread that on, too. Then you add a splash of balsamic—the&lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://thinkexist.com/quotation/poor_faulkner-does_he_really_think_big_emotions/145004.html" rel="nofollow" class="external_link" target="_blank" onmouseover="return require(&amp;quot;qtext&amp;quot;).tooltip(this, &amp;quot;thinkexist.com&amp;quot;)"&gt; 10-dollar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; kind—and a swirl of honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is incredible. It takes all your willpower not to eat every piece of this new strawberry-honey-ricotta bruschetta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crisis averted, you&amp;#039;re merrily welcoming your guests in short order. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;How&amp;#039;s the bruschetta?&amp;quot; you ask your Italian friend Sophia after she&amp;#039;s had a few bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;Delizioso&lt;/i&gt;,&amp;quot; she says. &amp;quot;Very good. I can&amp;#039;t taste the olive oil, though.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The strawberries really steal the show, don&amp;#039;t they?&amp;quot; you say, trying to hide a proud grin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The whole idea of bruschetta is to taste the new olive oil as soon as it comes out of the press.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But those strawberries are from the Ferry Building farmers market, you think. Organic. Artisanal. Hand-picked. Free-range. Grown sustainably, even, on the same farm that supplies berries to famed chef Stephen Rothchild&amp;#039;s Michelin-starred restaurant! How could she not appreciate them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#039;s easy to write off the person who asked this question as simple-minded. And who knows, maybe that&amp;#039;s correct. Maybe she&amp;#039;s a third-grader trying to tackle Infinite Jest. Some things are heady by design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But often, more often than writers like to admit, readers struggle to get through a piece because of the writer. Readers come to us expecting a good story and instead get a mouthful of strawberries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether the reader likes strawberries is irrelevant. She&amp;#039;s here for the olive oil, and she can&amp;#039;t taste it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider that the asker is a real Italian who knows her bruschetta. Someone who can tell when she&amp;#039;s being fed bullshit coated in sugar extracted from açai berries foraged in the Brazillian rainforest. Someone who knows you didn&amp;#039;t use good olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In our defense, fine writing is a luxury. Writers don&amp;#039;t often have the time—or the humility—to wait to review a piece with fresh eyes. It&amp;#039;s unsettling to look at something you wrote and realize that it needs a rewrite; that the olive orchard has been infested with a fruit fly, so to speak, and will need replanting and another five years to reach maturation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#039;s easier to feed you strawberries. Or in my case, spices:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="qtext_image zoomable_in zoomable_in_feed" src="http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4fd2729476e8742eb603bb8928295d41" master_src="http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c0b343bad959517ab0b59637cb08ac11" master_w="700" master_h="393"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A shifty-eyed guy at the coffee shop the other day opened his coat and showed &amp;#039;em to me. &amp;quot;These&amp;#039;ll make you a real juggernaut on the literary scene,&amp;quot; he promised. I took a couple home for 10 cents apiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have a readymade remedy for sentences like this one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It looked like a storm was coming.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grammar is sound. The words get the job done. But it&amp;#039;s nothing special, nor is the rest of the essay from which it was lifted. What to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know! Those words could use some synonyms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&amp;#039;s try some:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a bouquet of petrichor in the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Petrichor! The smell of rain on the earth! &lt;i&gt;That is exactly what I wanted to say!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My spice rack has saved the day again, I think, until I read this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&amp;#039;s the opening line to &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="/Neuromancer-1984-Book"&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. It&amp;#039;s simple, works well, and isn&amp;#039;t gimmicky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&amp;#039;t know William Gibson, but from personal experience I can attest that a good sentence like that takes time—not time in a thesaurus but time in your head, thinking and thinking and trusting the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hemingway and Alice Waters have it right: Simple is better. But simple isn&amp;#039;t easy. Simple takes time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&amp;#039;s much faster to pick a strawberry than it is to grow new olives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Writing/Why-do-so-many-writers-use-words-that-might-be-difficult-for-some-readers"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">5:79b4fbcc6b224dfc526c8a402974e1d6#1362076908641453</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2013 18:41:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What is a good web-based tool for reading authenticated RSS feeds?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/RSS-1/What-is-a-good-web-based-tool-for-reading-authenticated-RSS-feeds/answer/Samuel-Clay</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In RSS: Samuel Clay added an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_223"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_Rpq9cjg_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_Rpq9cjg_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/Samuel-Clay" routing="q://user/(12196)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_Rpq9cjg_link"&gt;Samuel Clay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can prepend your username and password to the URL if the feed is protected with HTTP Basic Authentication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://username:password@example.com/feed.xml" rel="nofollow" class="external_link" target="_blank"&gt;http://username:password@&lt;wbr /&gt;example...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works on &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newsblur.com" rel="nofollow" class="external_link" target="_blank" onmouseover="return require(&amp;quot;qtext&amp;quot;).tooltip(this, &amp;quot;newsblur.com&amp;quot;)"&gt;NewsBlur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but it should work on Google Reader as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/RSS-1/What-is-a-good-web-based-tool-for-reading-authenticated-RSS-feeds"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">5:deeb71f9088d753b771bfac94eab54ca#1362076569502235</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2013 18:36:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Is it worth it to open-source my startup?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/Startups/Is-it-worth-it-to-open-source-my-startup/answer/Samuel-Clay</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In Startups: Samuel Clay added an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_224"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_Qo87Y7T_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_Qo87Y7T_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/Samuel-Clay" routing="q://user/(12196)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_Qo87Y7T_link"&gt;Samuel Clay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, it all depends. It depends on a few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where is your core business?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it in the algorithms you use or in the community you fostered? If somebody were to take your code and make a carbon copy, they wouldn&amp;#039;t get very far without the community. And you&amp;#039;re still the original. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are you charging money for a product or a service?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I run a personal news reader, and while you can download NewsBlur&amp;#039;s source code and run your own product, the value is in the service. Specifically the service is in fetching hundreds or thousands of feeds regularly and keeping the product up to date, which is not an inexpensive service. Economies of scale make this possible to turn into a business, so keeping NewsBlur&amp;#039;s source open doesn&amp;#039;t detract from the business side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you plan to integrate with others?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are heavy on API integrations, it makes life a whole lot easier to be able to show your source and specify parameters to third-party developers. NewsBlur has a healthy third-party developer ecosystem and allowing them to be able to see exactly what&amp;#039;s happening under the hood has been instrumental in getting more apps supporting NewsBlur&amp;#039;s API.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you expect to see others contribute back to your code?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#039;s rare but not impossible for your users to want a pet feature and to do the work themselves. Oftentimes they get 25-50% of the way done, but showing the initiative is enough to have me come in and complete the rest of the integration. This wouldn&amp;#039;t be possible without an open-source code base, but you also have to have a significant enough segment of fairly technical users who love your service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You specified a number of positive reasons to go ahead with it. The likelihood of somebody stealing your business is very small, whereas the likelihood of you benefiting personally by showcasing your work is much higher. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a number of businesses that have a significant, if not entire, chunk of their code bases open. It may make more sense to open-source components that are useful, although this is a ton of work in itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Startups/Is-it-worth-it-to-open-source-my-startup"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">5:35f27ac8553fe5854dd04946e516ac20#1361994025400253</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 Feb 2013 19:40:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What websites allow you to rent camera equipment to other people (aka 'p2p rent camera equipment')?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/Online-Marketplaces/What-websites-allow-you-to-rent-camera-equipment-to-other-people-aka-p2p-rent-camera-equipment/answer/Adam-Derewecki</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In Online Marketplaces: Samuel Clay voted up an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_225"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_kZjRT4I_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_kZjRT4I_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/Adam-Derewecki" routing="q://user/(2330)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_kZjRT4I_link"&gt;Adam Derewecki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In January of this year, I launched &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.CameraLends.com" rel="nofollow" class="external_link" target="_blank" onmouseover="return require(&amp;quot;qtext&amp;quot;).tooltip(this, &amp;quot;cameralends.com&amp;quot;)"&gt;CameraLends&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to address this issue exactly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As pointed out in other answers, there are already established sites like BorrowLenses and LensRentals that work based on drop shipping. It&amp;#039;s great for professional photographers; people who know what ROI they can get for renting a specific body, lens, etc. It&amp;#039;s NOT great for people who are just getting more serious about photography; in fact it&amp;#039;s quite daunting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, keeping that in mind, CameraLends has a few differentiators:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;emphasis on local&lt;/b&gt;. All of the reservations that have happened so far have been inside a 10 mile radius, and most were fulfilled by walking. This also allows for last minute rentals, as I did this past Saturday (decided I wanted a camera for an afternoon hike at 12:30, had the camera by 1:00).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;emphasis on helping people learn&lt;/b&gt; about the gear/photography. I touched upon this earlier: &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://BorrowLenses.com" rel="nofollow" class="external_link" target="_blank" onmouseover="return require(&amp;quot;qtext&amp;quot;).tooltip(this, &amp;quot;borrowlenses.com&amp;quot;)"&gt;Borrowlenses.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is perfect if you know exactly what you want, but not really if you don&amp;#039;t. All of the rentals on CameraLends have involved a &amp;quot;tech handoff&amp;quot;, where the equipment owner makes sure the renter knows how to use the equipment before their reservation starts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;emphasis on community&lt;/b&gt;. In the way that AirBnB, GetAround, Lyft, Sidecar, and other &amp;quot;resource sharing&amp;quot; apps have a sense of &amp;quot;these are real people I&amp;#039;m interacting with,&amp;quot; I&amp;#039;m trying to replicate that feeling with CameraLends. And really, it feels good to know your telephoto is seeing some action even if you haven&amp;#039;t touched it in six months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything is still pretty nascent, but I expect that the renting audience will not be professional photographers (or people who use BorrowLenses already), but rather semi-pro and curious folk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another point in other answers is that at $7/day, it&amp;#039;s too low to be worth it. We&amp;#039;ve seen so far that people rarely rent just one item, so the average &amp;quot;package&amp;quot; is closer to $25/day, and making $75 for a 3 day weekend isn&amp;#039;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said -- I&amp;#039;d love for the Quora&amp;#039;s community&amp;#039;s input on this project.

Church&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Well, the first question to ask is: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;where does office politics come from?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Obviously, it comes from systems that provide incentives for people to play political games. Such incentives could be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;severe disparities in outcomes that appear to come more from popularity than actual contribution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;job insecurity.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a work allocation protocol that doesn&amp;#039;t adequately match people with work they&amp;#039;ll find interesting, forcing people to gain control of the division of labor (i.e. become managers) if they want work relevant to their career aspirations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;large &amp;quot;ball of mud&amp;quot; projects that make their architects and leads look good while grunts do all the work and, because individual performance is often hard to demonstrate, get no recognition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;importance attached to job titles and position in the organizational hierarchy.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Those are just a few of the toxic elements that foster political nastiness, but there&amp;#039;s one big one that runs through all of them: &lt;b&gt;companies, even small ones, have a tendency to hire before they trust. &lt;/b&gt;This is bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust has degrees, of course, and I&amp;#039;m not saying that new hires should be trusted with the whole store. However, &lt;b&gt;most companies get into a mode where the default attitude toward the average worker is one of distrust.&lt;/b&gt; The &amp;quot;bozo bit&amp;quot; is on, until the worker gains &amp;quot;credibility&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;track record&amp;quot;, and that takes years. The worker is micromanaged, not even trusted with hours or days of her time. Once this is the prevailing mentality, you have a 2-class company. You have the higher-ups and managers who are trusted and given autonomy, and the &amp;quot;everyone else&amp;quot; category who aren&amp;#039;t really in the club. (Three-class companies occur when the manager/executive delineation becomes sharp.) People don&amp;#039;t want to be in this latter category and will do all kinds of nasty things to lift themselves out of it. When people are treated like criminals, they become more unethical. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&amp;#039;s how companies get fucked up... and what to avoid. These aren&amp;#039;t &amp;quot;big company&amp;quot; illnesses exclusively. In fact, large companies have more experience dealing with this kind of crap than do the worse small firms. These problems can appear in 5 to 20 person companies easily. They could occur in a 2-person company if the relationship were one-sided and toxic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how does one prevent this devolution from happening?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open allocation.&lt;/b&gt; See &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="/Software-Development-Methodologies/What-is-Open-Allocation"&gt;Software Development Methodologies: What is Open Allocation?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; As long as people are working on things that benefit the company, &lt;b&gt;let people work on whatever they want.&lt;/b&gt; Someone wants to transfer to a team? She moves her desk to their corner, that afternoon. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reason&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: once the division of labor is no longer a political favor to be &amp;quot;allocated&amp;quot;, people don&amp;#039;t have to play politics to get good projects, so they don&amp;#039;t. They just work on the things that interest them, and are too busy to fuck around or gossip. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The main stakes should be doing something cool.&lt;/b&gt; A lot of these startups think their profit-sharing programs are progressive, while employee #106 gets 0.04% when a VP hired at the same time is offered 1%, or 25x more. People always find out about these inequities and it&amp;#039;s really bad for morale. Compensation shouldn&amp;#039;t be uniformly distributed (that itself would be unfair) but it should be allocated in a way that&amp;#039;s reasonable, and so that climbing the corporate ladder doesn&amp;#039;t improve a person&amp;#039;s comp. that much. Pay for &lt;i&gt;achievements&lt;/i&gt;, not position, and keep the main motivation to do cool work, not to reach X title in Y years. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reason&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: corporate ladder-climbing is the source of most politics. That&amp;#039;s the bulk of what provides the incentive to do it. If you reduce the benefits of climbing, you&amp;#039;re more likely to get real &lt;i&gt;leadership&lt;/i&gt; instead of narcissistic, game-playing assclowns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Never cold-fire.&lt;/b&gt; You may have to fire people. In fact, you will need to do it at some point because, if nothing else, you&amp;#039;ll have to fire toxic people to protect your environment. Give them a generous severance (enough to get the next job) that includes a good reference (unless they&amp;#039;re awful; then stick to name and dates) and the right to represent themselves as employed. Even if you hate writing severance packages (out of some emotional aversion to &amp;quot;rewarding failure&amp;quot;) do it. Severance isn&amp;#039;t a reward. It (a) buys you insurance against litigation and disparagement, and (b) gives your company a reputation of one that treats people well even when it terminates them. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reason&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;: &lt;/i&gt;if people aren&amp;#039;t worried about getting thrown out on the street, there&amp;#039;s less anxiety and they can focus on their work. If you write severances, chances are people will never find out that a firing occurred (a win-win face-saving). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take mentorship and career growth seriously.&lt;/b&gt; Everyone should feel that they are learning more and faster from their work than they would if they were given a comparable amount of money but let to direct their own time. The work should be additive to their educational process, not subtractive. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reason&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: when people start to feel like they&amp;#039;re falling behind where they should be, educationally speaking, they start to get nervous and suspicious. If people feel like they&amp;#039;re learning more working with you than they would anywhere else, they&amp;#039;re happy. Career coherence is taken care of, and they can focus on the task at hand. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Grow slowly, hire selectively, and hire &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;honestly.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Don&amp;#039;t hire a person if you aren&amp;#039;t ready to trust that person with, at least, full autonomy over her own time. Don&amp;#039;t grow so fast that you have a different company every week. Finally, be honest about the culture you have and want to maintain when you hire, and especially make it clear to executives that they&amp;#039;ll probably have less power than they&amp;#039;re used to (they can&amp;#039;t just intimidate people into doing stuff). &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reason&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: hiring is the most important thing to get right when it comes to preserving a culture, and hard to reverse. Even if you do (3) to a T, it&amp;#039;s hard to fire people without an effect on the culture. What I&amp;#039;ve observed is that a lot of the companies that start out with a great culture and lose it do so in hiring executives; they sell it off piecemeal to get supposedly &amp;quot;high-power&amp;quot; people who actually don&amp;#039;t fit well with the team and turn into net negatives. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Everyone participates in belt-tightening.&lt;/b&gt; HP in its glory days, instead of laying people off, would cut salaries 10% across the board, and compensate by offering non-executives one day off every 2 weeks. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reason&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: people will trust and like the executives more if this is how difficult economic times are handled. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep projects small. &lt;/b&gt;If you&amp;#039;re a software company, make the programmer-to-program relationship one-to-many instead of many-to-one. Everyone should be able to own something, even if it&amp;#039;s small, in order to have a sense of real contribution and standing in the company. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reason&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; this keeps the impostor syndrome and, &amp;quot;Just what does he do here?&amp;quot; suspicions at bay. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encourage workplace friendships.&lt;/b&gt; Those are rare in the workplace. I tend to think that typical outings (team trips to Hawaii) are expensive and don&amp;#039;t do much (everyone is still on guard, and most people would rather go with family than officemates). Encourage cheaper, smaller, and voluntary workplace outings, to baseball games and museums. Or just hold board game nights. Those can be pretty great as well. The goal is to make it possible for real companionship to form. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reason&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: People are less inclined to play underhanded political games when people whose opinions they actually care about are watching. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Avoid &amp;quot;managerial mystique&amp;quot;. &lt;/b&gt;In many companies, the attitude becomes that managers make decisions and don&amp;#039;t explain them. Avoid this. Explain sensitive or difficult decisions, especially if they affect the way people work. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reason:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; managerial mystique creates the bilateral distrust leads to the two-class company. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a great culture is unlikely to happen by accident, because bad cultures aren&amp;#039;t always a result of bad people. You have to actively manage it to prevent people from falling back into old patterns, and there&amp;#039;s no formula for this, but I hope that I&amp;#039;ve given a good starting point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Startups/What-is-the-best-way-to-create-and-foster-an-environment-that-has-minimal-office-politics"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">5:25f21fb11b4ceda2422d7a298655146d#1356467431138953</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Dec 2012 20:30:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What happens to the elastic potential energy of a compressed metal spring when it is dissolved in acid?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/Physics/What-happens-to-the-elastic-potential-energy-of-a-compressed-metal-spring-when-it-is-dissolved-in-acid/answer/Geoffrey-Widdison</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In Physics: Samuel Clay voted up an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_230"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_N8FCLkN_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_N8FCLkN_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/Geoffrey-Widdison" routing="q://user/(6282366)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_N8FCLkN_link"&gt;Geoffrey Widdison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&amp;#039;s a excellent question with a disappointingly mundane answer. Like most energy when it changes forms, it ends up as waste heat. In this case, the individual metal atoms under tension become metal ions with higher kinetic energy. They transfer this energy to the acid solution and make it slightly warmer than it was before. As the spring gets eaten, eventually little splinters of metal will start to be thrown off by the elastic tension, creating kinetic energy, but they&amp;#039;ll quickly lose their speed in the liquid and that energy also becomes heat energy.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;As one of my old textbooks states, &amp;quot;heat is the energy graveyard&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Physics/What-happens-to-the-elastic-potential-energy-of-a-compressed-metal-spring-when-it-is-dissolved-in-acid"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">5:12d6552ca921592981a829bd6449597b#1356467157077524</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Dec 2012 20:25:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What are good alternatives to "My Yahoo!" on PC and iPad?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/What-are-good-alternatives-to-My-Yahoo-on-PC-and-iPad/answer/Matt-Jordan-1</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;Samuel Clay voted up an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_231"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_bMl9HZH_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_bMl9HZH_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/Matt-Jordan-1" routing="q://user/(3278434)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_bMl9HZH_link"&gt;Matt Jordan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newsblur is an awesome service for keeping up with the stories and sites that interest you.

I had a love of computers and writing, but I decided to abandon computers because being a geek in high school was so unrewarding. I applied to three &amp;#039;big name&amp;#039; schools (Harvard, Stanford, and MIT), UC schools (Berkeley, UCLA, UCSD), and three small liberal arts colleges (Oberlin, Swarthmore, and Carleton). Carleton was far and away my first choice. I&amp;#039;d visited the campus and found the small but focused liberal arts culture to be exactly what I was looking for. Located about 40 miles south of Minneapolis/St. Paul in Northfield, Minnesota, I thought I&amp;#039;d also find an experience very different than the life I had in the San Fernando Valley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked two of my favorite teachers to write my college recommendations. Teaching English and Calculus, they were also the coaches of my Academic Decathlon team (and they eventually dated and got married, but that&amp;#039;s probably outside the scope of this post).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I handed them the recommendation forms, they looked at each other and she asked, &amp;quot;Are you sure you want &lt;b&gt;us&lt;/b&gt; to write them?&amp;quot; I instantly knew this was one of those moments that required a definitive answer, right off the bat. Either take that feedback along with the forms, thank them, and find other teachers to write my recommendations, or acknowledge that these were the two teachers who knew me best, and tell them with certainty &amp;quot;Absolutely. You two know me better than any other teachers,&amp;quot; counting on that vote of confidence to reflect positively in the recommendations they were to write. &lt;b&gt;I chose the latter.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, a bit of background here is needed. In high school I was a fantastic test-taker, and a horrible procrastinator. I would learn everything the class had to teach, but usually on my own in the final weeks of the class, or immediately before each unit test. Assignments were chores to be avoided or rushed through, and test were the saviors that would buoy my grades. If not for teachers using tests to comprise the majority of their courses grades, I would have done more assignments, and done them better. I just did the math and saw that if I aced tests I wouldn&amp;#039;t have to work hard on the rest. And so while in the top 5% of my class and with SAT scores in the 99th percentile, I was still considered a poor student.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the next several months college applications were filled out, recommendations were written, paperwork was submitted, and we entered the long cold winter of expectations and anticipation. My two teachers had the custom of giving their students copies of the recommendations they wrote, a tradition they broke with in my case. This was my first (though clearly should have been my second) clue that my college plans might not be as bright as I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To cut to the chase, of the nine schools I applied to, six of them required teacher recommendations and those were the six schools I was rejected from. The three schools I was accepted to (UC Berkeley, UCLA and UCSD), relied almost entirely on mathematica formulas, which made me a shoo-in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I went to UC Berkeley, intending to major in either Physics, English, or Dramatic Arts (yeah, I know, a lot of people have no idea what they want to do when they start college though). Within the first two weeks there I met folks from the Berkeley Mac Users Group, started volunteering on their helpline a few weeks later, got a job as their campus liaison a few months later, got an internship at MacWEEK magazine a few months after that, started independently developing software for the Apple Newton, then moved over to web development (back in 1995 when the web was in its dark ages), spent as many years out of school as I had in, taking a year or two out here and there to work for SoMa web companies, and finally returned to Berkeley to finish my degree when their Cognitive Science department had fully taken root and I realized that was exactly the education I was looking for, blending my liberal arts and scientific interests into a greater whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally graduated from Berkeley 10 years after I started, firmly entrenched in the technological world. I spent a year designing at Yahoo before leaving to get a masters degree in HCI at Carnegie Mellon where I met my wife, and then came back to the Bay Area to design UX for Google in 2003. My life is completely different than it would have been if I spent the first four years of my post-secondary life in Northfield, Minnesota studying literature and creative writing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#039;ll never know what that life would have held, but the life I have now is so different and so much more fulfilling than the fears I had as a graduating senior about pursuing computer science. Every aspect of my life can be traced back to that one moment when I made a snap decision in answering the question &amp;quot;Are you sure you want &lt;b&gt;us&lt;/b&gt; to write your recommendations?&amp;quot; In the short term I thought I gave the worst possible answer to that question, but in the long term it was the best mistake I ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Life/How-did-one-small-decision-change-your-entire-life"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">5:c7e2bb376ee78b5db41ff4adced758e6#1354655264957912</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Dec 2012 21:07:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What are the reasons that enforce engineers to learn so much math?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/Engineering-1/What-are-the-reasons-that-enforce-engineers-to-learn-so-much-math/answer/Michael-O-Church</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In Engineering: Samuel Clay voted up an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_233"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_hNFeWgl_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_hNFeWgl_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/Michael-O-Church" routing="q://user/(2038726)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_hNFeWgl_link"&gt;Michael O. Church&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fundamental problem with this argument, &amp;quot;No one needs math because of computers&amp;quot;, is that (a) it assumes machines always work perfectly, which is patently false, and (b) it has a condescendingly restricted definition of &amp;quot;math&amp;quot;. Mathematicians don&amp;#039;t spend their time adding 7-digit numbers together. Machines have taken that over. But there&amp;#039;s plenty of creative and often very difficult work left for mathematicians to do. Machines are nowhere close to being able to do proof-based mathematics for most classes of theorems. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&amp;#039;t understand mathematics, you can&amp;#039;t work on the most interesting computer science problems. Machine learning is out without probability and linear algebra. Applied numerical analysis usually requires that you understand the real number system, which has a lot of non-intuitive properties (cf. real analysis). Finally, without an understanding of the mathematical intuitions underlying computing, and more importantly the mathematical way of thinking, it becomes impossible to reason about whether the machine (or the program, software bugs being common while hardware defects are more rare) is &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt;

It did not contain sufficient gravitational mass to coalesce and even if it did, it would merely be a star system with some gaseous planets.&amp;nbsp; No heavier elements existed within the nebula to allow rocky, silicon, carbon, iron planets to form.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several light years away, existed a super-massive star.&amp;nbsp; Probably many hundreds, if not thousands of times our current star&amp;#039;s mass.&amp;nbsp; It was one of the &lt;i&gt;fore-mothers &lt;/i&gt;of our section of the galaxy.&amp;nbsp; She probably only lived a few million years, as she--being a super giant--burned through her fuel at a hyper-rapid pace.&amp;nbsp; This was around 4.6 billion years ago and her life came to an abrupt and fortunate end.&amp;nbsp; So large was she, that her collapse was to form the largest type of explosion in the universe--second only to the Big Bang.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That explosion is called a supernova and it caused a shock wave of heavier elements (formed during its collapse) to blast out towards our stellar nursery consisting of simple hydrogen atoms.&amp;nbsp; That shock wave caused the nebula to compress just enough for its very weak gravity to begin to have an affect on all the matter within the cloud.&amp;nbsp; Included in that blast were the rare elements that made our existence possible:&amp;nbsp; carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, nickel, silicon, calcium and dozens more.&amp;nbsp; The guts of that super giant, cast out during the death of our grandmother star, have been recycled into the bodies of every living creature that ever existed on the Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I&amp;#039;ve heard it aptly said that, when you gain a true understanding of the terrible beauty of the cosmos and all the celestial transactions that came before us, you truly don&amp;#039;t need myths, legends and made up religions.&amp;nbsp; What could possibly compare to the fact that &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;the stars had to die so that we could live&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; We are literally star children, the elements of creation, formed in the most awesome of serendipitous events.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Solar Nebula began to collapse on its own gravity the process accelerated again and again.&amp;nbsp; It could no longer be stopped and would continue its inexorable course to form a new star.&amp;nbsp; As we see with an ice skater pulling her hands in while spinning, as the cloud collapsed it began to rotate more rapidly in the maelstrom of creation.&amp;nbsp; Downward and downward into the core, the gas continued to fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There wasn&amp;#039;t really a &amp;quot;star&amp;quot; in the center yet, only a relatively dense blob of gas that was beginning to collapse under its weight, forming a sphere at the center of the disk of gas.&amp;nbsp; As more gas collapsed into the cloud, the gravity increased as well.&amp;nbsp; In a series of cascading effects that drew more gas, increased gravity, drawing more gas, again and again, the core of the &lt;i&gt;prenatal &lt;/i&gt;system began to form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cloud became a ball of swirling gas and liquid of great density, many times that of planets Jupiter or Saturn.&amp;nbsp; From there, more and more gas was pulled into this beast of a sphere, swallowing each bit like a hungry giant.&amp;nbsp; Surrounding the giant was massive haze of even more gas and a disk containing hundreds of glowing balls--the planets were taking shape as well.&amp;nbsp; The process continued to accelerate.&amp;nbsp; Trillions and trillions of tons of gas continued collapsing into the enormous celestial body.&amp;nbsp; And the critical moment was nearly at hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Atoms began to collapse.&amp;nbsp; The proto-star began to shimmer from the compression of all the weight of the atoms rubbing violently against one another causing heat and photons to be expelled in the process.&amp;nbsp; It was likely thousands of degrees, not yet hot enough to be a star, though nearly there.&amp;nbsp; Our unborn star system finally had a source of light and limited warmth.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, trillions and trillions of tons of gas kept collapsing into the center of the proto-star-system and feeding the nascent Sun.&amp;nbsp; And the process accelerated and accelerated, again and again; and the gravity grew and grew and more gas collapsed and fell inward until a critical point was reached when the stars mass and gravity could not be kept at bay by simple friction and the mass of the star collapsed inward on its own weight, compressing itself to a fraction of its original size.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The atoms in the star suddenly burst, began to fuse together and form helium&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; Nuclear fusion had begun.&amp;nbsp; Trillions of watts of energy were now emanating from the Sun.&amp;nbsp; In a final collapse and explosion, a shock wave cast off from the star, scattered the inner gas outward into the system and sucked everything nearby into the glowing Sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Solar System was officially born.&amp;nbsp; Swirling around that young Sun were likely hundreds of proto-planets orbiting at all levels in regular and irregular orbits.&amp;nbsp; They were small but growing, gobbling up massive amounts of debris, gas and other planetoids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As time went on, the gravity of the growing planets began to grow and attract themselves to the others and they, again, collided and grew substantially.&amp;nbsp; Each planet grew quickly as they collided with each other.&amp;nbsp; While we had a star, the system was still in its infancy and was changing rapidly with passage of just a few million years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roughly 150 million kilometers from the new star was a red hot body, a planet less than half our current Earth&amp;#039;s mass.&amp;nbsp; It orbited the Sun fairly rapidly and it was spinning so fast that its equator bulged outward.&amp;nbsp; It, too, was sucking up stellar debris, gas and asteroids.&amp;nbsp; It was the stellar-fetus of what would one day be our home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the planet, itself, already had lots of water locked in its red-hot body, it was nonetheless being pummeled by comets and meteorites that contained massive amounts of water.&amp;nbsp; It was purely magma, no solid matter anywhere on or under its surface.&amp;nbsp; As it grew, its spin began to slow.&amp;nbsp; Slowly but surely, that planet crept outward, away from the star.&amp;nbsp; It was a toxic ball, boiling and billowing noxious fumes from within its turbulent core, glowing red hot in the cold of space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At some point, as the proto-Earth drifted toward its current orbit, a stellar body on an irregular orbit careened toward the infantile planet.&amp;nbsp; Likely the size of Mars, it smashed into the Earth at many thousands of miles per hour.&amp;nbsp; It hit the Earth at &lt;i&gt;just &lt;/i&gt;the right angle, causing some of the planet&amp;#039;s lighter crust to be blasted into space, while its dense core melted into the planet, re-igniting its surface, and liquifying its crust for millions of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a few hundred thousand years, the debris in orbit around the young Earth (within the Roche Limit) was pulled back to the surface and the matter outside of the Limit coalesced into a relatively light body that became our Moon.&amp;nbsp; It orbited at only 25,000 KM (or so) and rotated around the Earth rapidly.&amp;nbsp; To this very day it creeps away from the Earth several inches each year and will one day leave it altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Three fortunate gifts were bequeathed to our Earth by this apocolyptic collision:&amp;nbsp; our Moon, our disproportionately large metal core (the joining of two planets&amp;#039; hearts) and our thinner crust (due to much of it being blasted into space during the collision).&amp;nbsp; And what gifts they were! Our moon acted to stabilize our planet&amp;#039;s spin by negating the gravitational molestations of our sister planets.&amp;nbsp; Our larger metal core produced a more powerful magnetic field protecting us from solar radiation.&amp;nbsp; Lastly our thinner crust permitted tectonic plates and periodic (and extreme) vulcanism whose contributions to our existence has always been more boom boon than bane. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still the Earth gobbled up stellar matter and grew and grew.&amp;nbsp; Not quite the size of planet we call home today, the Earth was quickly approaching her final size.&amp;nbsp; The hot atmosphere was extraordinarily dense, many hundreds of time thicker than our current atmosphere.&amp;nbsp; It contained mostly evaporated water that had been boiled away when the rogue planet struck the Earth along with a large amount of CO2, ammonia and methane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And slowly and surely, the Earth began to cool.&amp;nbsp; The temperature dropped and dropped until, finally, it dipped below a critical point.&amp;nbsp; In a flash, the trillions and trillions and trillions of tons of water in the atmosphere began to rain from the sky.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#039;s likely that it rained for millions of years as the water condensed into streams of rain that would make a hurricane today look like picnic weather.&amp;nbsp; As it struck partially molten surface of the planet, it re-evaporated back into the air.&amp;nbsp; Over and over, and slowly and surely, the water caused the surface to finally solidify and accept the deluge from the sky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the young moon was so close, its gravity ripped and kneaded the Earth, causing more vulcanism to spew magma and water to the surface while comets—rich in water and organic material—bombarded the crust daily, increasing the size of the oceans and the overall mass of the planet.&amp;nbsp; While the amount of water was massive, it is likely the Earth&amp;#039;s surface had about half its current volume (roughly 650 million cubic kilometers of water).&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was almost no oxygen in the atmosphere, just a combination of deadly gasses that could never support life as we know it.&amp;nbsp; The Earth&amp;#039;s waters were no better, containing a toxic slurry of hot liquid, and all manner of caustic chemicals, organic molecules and &lt;i&gt;giga-tons &lt;/i&gt;of iron, making the waters an alien shade of jade green.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And slowly the bombardment lessened, and the Moon crept away from the Earth.&amp;nbsp; The planet had no mountains as there were no tectonic plates yet.&amp;nbsp; The surface was just a few miles thick.&amp;nbsp; Churning and boiling underneath the crust was hot magma, still many thousands of degrees.&amp;nbsp; Tempests of oceans ripped across the surface.&amp;nbsp; The planet had no visible land masses, just a mile deep planetary ocean, green like algae but containing only the smallest pre-eminent particles of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there were still no land masses.&amp;nbsp; The Earth was an ocean world, miles deep with water.&amp;nbsp; Over the next hundred million years, the size of the Earth and amount of water reached, relatively, what we have today. As the rocky surface under the oceans solidified, the gravitational forces of the Moon and the Sun, combined with the roiling heat within the Earth&amp;#039;s core, broke apart the rocky crust into plates that began to shift and move about in chaotic patterns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These plates crashed into one another.&amp;nbsp; As they did, they created peaks.&amp;nbsp; Volcanoes also began to create small protrusions out of the oceanic surface.&amp;nbsp; And more and more the massive forces of the crust cause land masses to grow and grow, until finally, the oceans parted and made way for land masses, containing cooled dirt, constantly eroded by the planet&amp;#039;s weather.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Whether delivered by a comet, an alien force, by a powerful deity or (most likely) by natural forces near fumaroles at the ocean depths, organic materials began to form self-replicating strands of proteins.&amp;nbsp; These proteins would one day evolve into every life form on Earth.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Within a few hundred million years, the proteins in the oceans grew in complexity.&amp;nbsp; Hundreds of millions of years later, those proteins would grow into distinct organisms.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;One of those organisms began to use sunlight to convert CO2 into carbon, releasing toxic Oxygen that it cast off into the oceans around it.&amp;nbsp; None of this Oxygen made it into the atmosphere yet.&amp;nbsp; It was percolating through the waters, oxidizing the green iron, turning it brown, and causing it to settle on the ocean floor in thick layers that we--&lt;i&gt;one day millions of years later&lt;/i&gt;--would dig up to build our cities and our industries.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blue oceans now teemed with life and the atmosphere began to turn clear and blue with oxygen flooding out of the oceans.&amp;nbsp; Later still, the variety of organisms would explode, likely caused by the presence of oxygen in the waters, fights for food and the emergence of sensory organs (eyes, ears and olfactory).&amp;nbsp; These organs created competition amongst each other, allowing attacks and defenses, speeding up evolution in what we now know of as the &lt;i&gt;Cambrian Explosion&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upward and onward, the organisms crept out from the oceans and on to land.&amp;nbsp; First plants.&amp;nbsp; Then bugs.&amp;nbsp; Then amphibian-like creatures that would become reptiles, mammals and dinosaurs, birds and other distinct animals.&amp;nbsp; Wave after wave of extinction would bring about the rise of massive reptiles and then wipe them from the surface making room for mammals to take their place as the dominant species on the planet.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sweat glands&lt;/b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;leaking salty water and lactose onto eggs as an anti-biotic and moisturizer, later provided nutrients to newly hatched proto-mammals who licked it from their mother&amp;#039;s belly as food and water&lt;/i&gt;--continued to mutate until they formed the very device that gave mammals their greatest success mechanism: Mammary glands (and the root name of our class: &lt;i&gt;Mammals&lt;/i&gt;†).&amp;nbsp; They provided nutrition and a fostered the maternal bond of protection and education that further drove the success of our clade&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;Let there be no doubt that females--the mother mammals to us all--with their unique self-sacrifice and emotional attachment to their young, made every possible leap in our evolution the success that it was.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And those mammals&amp;#039; caring mothers created a pack instinct that spread out to all her descendants.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The emotional bond fostered by mammary glands permitted emotional bonds beyond nutrition, beyond mother.&amp;nbsp; The nascent &amp;quot;love&amp;quot;, created between breast and mouth, infant and mother, was the emotional spark that drove mammals to form all of the paternal bonds, sibling bonds and social bonds that we see in so many in our class to this day. Those profound instincts followed a group of early simians as they took to the trees, diversifying and growing as they spread.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The profound familial bonds created connections in simians that lasted for life.&amp;nbsp; Parents taught children how to survive.&amp;nbsp; Children cared for parents as they aged.&amp;nbsp; Not quite love yet, though not all that dis-similar, simians&amp;#039; connections to each other formed the strongest communities known in the mammal world.&amp;nbsp; This trait survives in us to this very day.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Millions of years later, a troop of highly developed simian-mammals . . . Ape-Humans . . . would leave the trees on the steppes of Africa.&amp;nbsp; Because of desertification, caused by the newly occurring Ice Ages, those apes would be forced to hunt other animals for foods. They would be forced to create tools for hunting because they were relatively weak.&amp;nbsp; They would branch out and continue diversifying, killing, growing, &lt;i&gt;evolving&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The use of tools created an even greater need for tools and those that developed the best tools lived and those that didn&amp;#039;t, died.&amp;nbsp; These&amp;nbsp; are called &amp;quot;auto-catalytic&amp;quot; traits:&amp;nbsp; that is, like a feedback&amp;nbsp; loop, each one made the next step possible, inevitable, and easier.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Each step sped up evolution and development of our society.&amp;nbsp; Those that were smarter bred, while those who weren&amp;#039;t passed into the obscurity of the ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And on and on this trend went for several hundred thousand years. Eventually vocal sounds were associated with items and the technology of language arrived and granted a troop of early humans mastery over its world.&amp;nbsp; They could now pass on massive amounts of knowledge to their young that other troops had to physically show, giving one a massive advantage, and cursing the other to extermination. This gave the tribe a powerful lever against everything on Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And still, the self-breeding continued.&amp;nbsp; Those that could make sounds and attach them to logical concepts, bred more.&amp;nbsp; Those that could not, were killed off.&amp;nbsp; Onward and upward humanity went, adding new tool to new tool over and over.&amp;nbsp; Mastery of bones and sharp rocks.&amp;nbsp; Mastery of clothing.&amp;nbsp; Mastery of fire (&lt;i&gt;EUREKA&lt;/i&gt;!). Partnership with canines. Animal husbandry.&amp;nbsp; Fields were sowed. Invention of the wheel.&amp;nbsp; Cities rose.&amp;nbsp; Civilization spread.&amp;nbsp; Technology advanced.&amp;nbsp; Bronze tools. Iron tools.&amp;nbsp; Mechanics.&amp;nbsp; Industrial era.&amp;nbsp; Electricity.&amp;nbsp; Atomic weapons.&amp;nbsp; Computers.&amp;nbsp; Genetics.&amp;nbsp; Space travel.&amp;nbsp; Singularity.&amp;nbsp; And the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story of where we came from to the very place in time where we are is one of such utterly grotesque beauty that the very least we can do is sit and marvel at our fortune, not just the fortune for humanity&amp;#039;s existence, but the exponentially infinitesimal odds against each of our existence. The precise sperm, out of hundreds of millions, fertilized your mother&amp;#039;s egg.&amp;nbsp; A slight shift in position, a delay of the moment, and someone else--perhaps no one else--would have existed to read this very &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;word&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; 1 in 200,000,000 is a good guess (and that&amp;#039;s just the odds of your father&amp;#039;s sperms at that moment; each sperm lasting a few days multiplied by the number of days your parents were together and mating before your birth).&amp;nbsp; Multiply that by all the matings of all the creatures that ever came before you since the dawn of time.&amp;nbsp; Ponder that for a moment and consider your--&lt;u&gt;your species&lt;/u&gt;&amp;#039;--good fortune.&amp;nbsp; There aren&amp;#039;t enough zeros that could fit on this page to show the &amp;quot;XXX to 1&amp;quot; chances of your very existence today.&amp;nbsp; Surely reason to celebrate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one day it will all end.&amp;nbsp; The Sun will burn itself out.&amp;nbsp; Long before that, the Milky Way will have collided with Andromeda, unleashing several billion years worth of star formation.&amp;nbsp; Even after our Sun dies, the child galaxy of the Andromeda-Milky Way mating, containing likely over a trillion stars, will create new stars, planets and--hopefully--a few intelligent beings to look up into the night sky and point at our ancient star, wondering about all the possibilities throughout the cosmos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With luck we--&lt;i&gt;or our evolutionary descendants, looking and acting nothing like us&lt;/i&gt;--will be there to witness it.&amp;nbsp; Later still, should there be no escape, all of the possible collisions that can happen will have. Throughout the Universe, all the possible stars will have been formed and begin to die.&amp;nbsp; The lights will twinkle out.&amp;nbsp; First the giant stars, then the medium stars, then the red dwarfs--living around a trillion years as they burn slowly.&amp;nbsp; Then the collapsed stars will shrink away.&amp;nbsp; Eons later, even the black holes will evaporate into space, because--contrary to myth--some energy does escape them, but ever so slowly.&amp;nbsp; Eventually, through the trickle of Hawking Radiation, the singularities evaporate away into nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, hundreds of trillions of years later, even the atoms will slowly (as they do now) disintegrate into their entropic particles of energy.&amp;nbsp; Trillions and trillions of years later, the energy contained in the universe will be so spread out as to be utterly unreachable and the universe in which we live will effectively cease to exist, as time--which is measured by movement of matter relative to other matter--will have no way of being measured.&amp;nbsp; And that will be the end of this universe that we call home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that won&amp;#039;t be for an unimaginably long period of time, &lt;i&gt;quintillions, even nonillions of years into the future&lt;/i&gt; (Quintillion:&amp;nbsp; 1,000,000,000,000,000,000&lt;wbr /&gt;; Nonillion:&amp;nbsp; 1,000,000,000,000,000,000&lt;wbr /&gt;,000,000,000,000).&amp;nbsp; So far beyond our time will that be, that this--the first 15 billion years of the Universe during the &lt;i&gt;Stelliferous Era*&lt;/i&gt;--will be as to that time, what the first moments of the universe are to us now.&amp;nbsp; It bears only pondering when conveying just how long time will be.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;For now, all that matters is where we came from and where we are going&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;_________________________&lt;wbr /&gt;_________________________&lt;wbr /&gt;_______________&lt;br /&gt;†&lt;b&gt;Yes&lt;/b&gt;, men, you can take pride that our class was named after boobies.&amp;nbsp; Cause for celebration, I guess!&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stelliferous Era: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The period of the Universe when new stars will be formed, live, shine and die. +/- a trillion years.&lt;br /&gt;_________________________&lt;wbr /&gt;_________________________&lt;wbr /&gt;_______________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;EDIT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been asked about reading or viewing materials that have contributed to this post.&amp;nbsp; As many of you know, I am -- regrettably -- not a scientist.&amp;nbsp; My education extends to chemistry and computer sciences.&amp;nbsp; I am passionate on a level that I will attest compares to many religious people who become overwhelmed with emotion at singing their songs and chanting their prayers.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#039;m moved by the fortune we&amp;#039;ve experienced and by the infinitesimal odds of our existence.&amp;nbsp; And yet, we&amp;#039;re here and must appreciate our short existence and learn as much about the cosmos as possible while we live.&amp;nbsp; So, while I will never be a scientist, I will spend the rest of my life reading and spreading the good news of science, rational thinking, evolution and cosmology.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the things I read are specifically intended for laymen such as myself, so if you&amp;#039;re the smart guy in the room who can visualize this stuff in the form of music or mathematics, then count your blessings.&amp;nbsp;

I certainly don&amp;#039;t &lt;i&gt;feel &lt;/i&gt;like 50, and most days I don&amp;#039;t &lt;i&gt;look &lt;/i&gt;like it, either. With sufficient sleep and daily use of a good moisturizer to smooth the wrinkles - sorry, &amp;#039;laughter lines&amp;#039; - around my eyes, I can pass for someone of 40 (well, on a good day...). But I think that I still have the philosophical perspective of a 50&amp;nbsp; year old (something for which I am frequently grateful), and I believe there is much truth in this maxim - &amp;#039;Youth is wasted on the young&amp;#039; - for the following reasons: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For entirely understandable and forgivable reasons, young people usually fail to realize just how lucky they are to be young, with all their physical, sexual and intellectual energy, their optimism, lack of cynicism and jadedness, and the many decades of life they have stretching out before them in which they can achieve their dreams (if they actually decide on their goals and then apply themselves to achieving them - which many, sadly, do not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you are young (late-teens to early twenties, say), your old age seems impossibly far away. You are not yet aware of the way in which the lengths of the years shrink, relative to your entire lifespan, as you age. In terms of the psychological perception of the passage of time, the years pass more rapidly as you get older; the seasons become closer together; the birthdays, anniversaries&amp;nbsp; and Christmases more frequent. Time literally seems to accelerate, and you become aware of the rapidly dwindling timeframe you have in which to achieve your life goals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But young people simply do not have this perception of temporal nonlinearity, and so they live their lives as if they were immortal, as if there will always be time to do the things they want or need to do, because time is on their side. The philosophy of the young is &amp;#039;mañana, mañana!&amp;#039;: put off till tomorrow the difficult or unpleasant tasks, the responsibilities and duties; and there will always be more opportunities to have new experiences, acquire new skills or embark on new adventures. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Go traveling in Europe? Learn the guitar? Visit relatives in New Zealand? See that band play? Dive on the Great Barrier Reef? Trek the Grand Canyon? Sure, that sounds like fun, but I can always do those things next year, or when I graduate, or get my first job,&amp;quot; they think to themselves. &amp;quot;Today, I can just coast along, and maybe do exactly the same thing I did yesterday, or last week, or last month, because that&amp;#039;s so much easier than thinking of something new to do, isn&amp;#039;t it? Why not just drift wherever the tide takes my boat, amuse myself with simple things and pass the time in trivial ways, or just distract myself with easily attainable, transitory pleasures. If it takes too much effort or planning, or involves deferred gratification rather than immediate reward then, &lt;i&gt;nah&lt;/i&gt;, that&amp;#039;s not for me - not yet, maybe when I&amp;#039;m older..&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the philosophy of the impulsive, hedonistic procrastinator, of course. But I don&amp;#039;t begrudge the young this carefree spirit, because I shared it myself once, and was happy to do so. You are only young once, and to be a young adult, while feeling this freedom from the burdens of adult life, is a wonderful thing. You will only get this one chance to experience it, and everyone should get that chance (though, sadly, many young people - such as teenage parents, the young unemployed, child soldiers, and so on - do not). That is probably why many older people look back upon their late teens and early twenties - perhaps when they were college students - as amongst the happiest years of their lives (I know they were for me), simply because they were full of carefree fun and new friendships and experiences, and were relatively unburdened by the adult responsibilities that were to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when we look back upon our youth, we are painfully aware of all the opportunities we squandered, and the experiences we never had, all because of this naive belief that there would always be enough time tomorrow (or next year, or before we got too old). And when we see young people making the same mistakes, we think, &amp;#039;Oh, if only they knew how fast these opportunities will pass them by; if only they understood the importance of squeezing the juice from life while they still have the chance.&amp;#039; But, equally, older people understand the importance of planning for the future (however tedious and &amp;#039;responsible&amp;#039; that sounds to young people), because the future will arrive at frightening speed, and it is best to be prepared for it. Both these things are, from the perspective of more mature years, important: live for the moment, and seize life by the throat, by all means, but don&amp;#039;t forget to make plans for the future, because you won&amp;#039;t be young forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is in this sense that we feel that &amp;#039;youth is wasted on the young&amp;#039;: we have learned from experience how quickly the opportunities for life experiences disappear, and it frustrates us to see young people squandering them when, if we had the chance to live our lives again, and be magically reborn as teenagers or college students, we would &lt;i&gt;seize the day&lt;/i&gt;, and suck the marrow from life, in the knowledge that we are mortal, and that our time on this earth is finite, so we had better make the most if it while we can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the song that best conveys the tragedy and pathos of wasted youth is &amp;#039;Time&amp;#039;, by Pink Floyd, from their classic album &amp;#039;Dark Side of the Moon&amp;#039;. Read, and pay heed, young people :o) :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day&lt;br /&gt;Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way&lt;br /&gt;Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town&lt;br /&gt;Waiting for someone or something to show you the way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain&lt;br /&gt;And you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today&lt;br /&gt;And then one day you find ten years have got behind you&lt;br /&gt;No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it&amp;#039;s sinking&lt;br /&gt;Racing around to come up behind you again&lt;br /&gt;The sun is the same in a relative way, but you&amp;#039;re older&lt;br /&gt;Shorter of breath and one day closer to death&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time&lt;br /&gt;Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines&lt;br /&gt;Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way&lt;br /&gt;The time is gone, the song is over, thought I&amp;#039;d something more to say&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWTLUmUjo8A" class="external_link" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/w&lt;wbr /&gt;atch?v=...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Footnote: It is ironic that for young people to be free to enjoy the opportunities of youth, they probably need a degree of financial self-sufficiency. And yet most young people are typically not very affluent (unless they have rich parents), and by the time they have acquired the financial means to pursue their youthful dreams, they are too old, either physically, psychologically, or in terms of their adult responsibilities (children, etc.), to really experience them to the fullest. So, it seems that young people have the energy and time to pursue their dreams, but not the financial means, while older people have the financial means, but no longer have the time or the energy for them. Life sucks, eh? Unless, that is, you decide to sponsor a young person to have the fun and do the things you missed out on when you were young. And there are far worse things to spend your savings on than empowering the youth of the world to make the best of their youth, eh? :o) (I know that&amp;#039;s what I plan to do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Youth/What-does-it-mean-to-say-youth-is-wasted-on-the-young"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">5:c152e3aa65a1a880f2726509538a27af#1354220584206969</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Nov 2012 20:23:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What is the difference between Pubsubhubbub and using a centralized message broker such as ActiveMQ?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/PubSubHubbub/What-is-the-difference-between-Pubsubhubbub-and-using-a-centralized-message-broker-such-as-ActiveMQ/answer/Samuel-Clay</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In PubSubHubbub: Samuel Clay added an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_236"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_lOiEt2Q_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_lOiEt2Q_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/Samuel-Clay" routing="q://user/(12196)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_lOiEt2Q_link"&gt;Samuel Clay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both require the setup of a server, but I think the simple answer is that it comes down to what you want to have happen if there are no consumers to answer the published message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In pub/sub, you have one publisher with multiple subscribers, and everybody gets the published messaged near the same time. If nobody is there, the message just gets dropped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With ActiveMQ, you are queuing messages to be read when a subscriber is available to read it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference is persistence. If you are running real-time updates that need to addressed at some point, use a queue. If you can drop the message with no real loss, use pubsub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/PubSubHubbub/What-is-the-difference-between-Pubsubhubbub-and-using-a-centralized-message-broker-such-as-ActiveMQ"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">5:1b0fa48e04d54482b70f131658b89c37#1353342524424135</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Nov 2012 16:28:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What should I keep in mind when planning a cross country trip on a motorcycle?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/Travel/What-should-I-keep-in-mind-when-planning-a-cross-country-trip-on-a-motorcycle/answer/Mike-Lewis-1</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In Travel: Samuel Clay voted up an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_237"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_isyDGkA_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_isyDGkA_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/Mike-Lewis-1" routing="q://user/(53436)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_isyDGkA_link"&gt;Mike Lewis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually did this trip recently. Left NYC at the beginning of October and arrived in SF in early November. Put around 4600 miles on my Suzuki C50 Boulevard. Straight shot is around 2600 miles, so I did a lot of meandering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The biggest thing you&amp;#039;ll need is time.&lt;/b&gt; Don&amp;#039;t rush it. Riding a bike is a lot more taxing on your mind and body than a car is, and you really don&amp;#039;t want to ride when exhausted. That&amp;#039;s how crashes happen. The other factor that time helps with is weather. You&amp;#039;re going to cover a lot of ground, so you&amp;#039;re bound to hit a few storms. The Weather Channel has a pretty good app for forecasts and viewing radar/rain video. Try to ride around storms if you can, but if you get stuck, a leisurely schedule makes it easier (mentally) to cut a day short and shack up someplace dry. Also, the trip is about the journey, give yourself time to enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that you have hard bags is a major blessing. That makes exploring/hiking a lot easier. Might even make sense to bungee down a daypack for getting off your bike and wandering around. Good stuff to put in there would be a flashlight, lighter, spare contacts (if you need them), water, pocketknife and other lightweight essentials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Have capacity for at least 2L of water.&lt;/i&gt; Drink up every time you stop for gas. Apply sunblock liberally. Dress in layers, you&amp;#039;ll experience wide ranges of weather over the course of the day, especially if you change altitudes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you go a southern route, it can be done all year, but you&amp;#039;ll miss the Rockies, and that&amp;#039;s just sad. Texas is no Colorado when it comes to interesting roads. On the upside, that means you get to skip Kansas, which is a seriously boring place to ride through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the high level advice out of the way, I&amp;#039;ll get into details as I experienced them on my trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;My route:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NYC -&amp;gt; Syracuse -&amp;gt; Rochester -&amp;gt; Pittsburgh -&amp;gt; Chicago -&amp;gt; St. Louis -&amp;gt; Kansas City -&amp;gt; Ft. Collins -&amp;gt; Rockies over rt 34 -&amp;gt; Moab (Arches) -&amp;gt; Grand Canyon -&amp;gt; Zion Canyon -&amp;gt; Las Vegas -&amp;gt; Death Valley -&amp;gt; Yosemite -&amp;gt; SF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some great experiences in the cities, but the trip was really about the journey and the roads. My strongest memories are of beautiful rides, amazing scenery, and hidden places. After living in NYC for 3 years, the man-made stuff wasn&amp;#039;t as impressive. Riding through dying, burnt out midwestern towns, talking with locals, seeing natural beauty, and chatting with other travelers were the parts that stuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Points of note:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kansas is boring as hell.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get BBQ in Kansas City.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The rockies stunned me to the core. I felt like a child riding through them. They put me behind by almost a day because I kept stopping to stare or take pictures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The parks in Utah (Arches, Zion) are beautiful, but are massive magnets for tourists. The most amazing experience I had in Utah actually happened by chance. I was trying to avoid a storrmfront and rerouted to go down the eastern boundary of Utah, along the Trail of the Ancients. It passes through Navajo country and some of the most astounding natural beauty I&amp;#039;ve ever seen, for endless miles. Also rode through a massive sandstorm on that leg, which just added to the adventure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Grand Canyon, no matter how many times you see it, never ceases to amaze. It&amp;#039;s way beyond words or photos in terms of how it can be conveyed. Just imagine the largest nothingness you possibly can. It&amp;#039;s way bigger than that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vegas was a fun detour. Paid for most of the trip in my 1 night of poker.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Death Valley is a pretty amazing experience. Not somewhere I&amp;#039;d go back to, but very much worth the ride through. It&amp;#039;s so damn desolate that it really sinks into you. Bring water, and fill your tank at every station (even if you&amp;#039;ve got more than half a tank left). Once you&amp;#039;re in canyonland, you can easily find yourself on very long stretches without a pump (and no warning that you&amp;#039;re entering desolation).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yosemite is stunningly beautiful. The valley is open year round, but Tioga Pass is closed in the winter due to elevation. The ride through the pass is a pretty beautiful experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Practical thoughts:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bring a hammock. It takes up very little room, but camping out between the trees were some of the best nights of the trip.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be careful around gravel. Don&amp;#039;t be afraid to ride at or below the speed limit if the road doesn&amp;#039;t feel comfortable. There&amp;#039;s nothing macho about wrecking your bike because the road signs were designed with cars in mind. Be especially careful about curve speed suggestion signs. In many areas the curves are blind and if you enter too fast you could get into a lot of trouble.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay sharp. If you&amp;#039;re exhausted, don&amp;#039;t ride. If you&amp;#039;re slow in the morning, grab some coffe (and a good meal). Any degradation in attention span or reaction time is a _REALLY_ bad thing, especially at highway speeds. Feeling invincible and comfortable 2000 miles later won&amp;#039;t make a crash any less fatal if you zone out and get surprised.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The radar detector may or may not be useful, depending upon how you ride. Most cops avoid pulling over bikes because there&amp;#039;s more risk of a crash. Unless you&amp;#039;re riding like an asshole. As a bigger question, what&amp;#039;s the rush? The faster you&amp;#039;re going, the less you&amp;#039;ll be able to notice the scenery. If you let the journey truly take you, the urge to rush everywhere melts away.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Windshield is a must, for both your hearing and your neck muscles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bring a GPS. Mount it to your handlebars and route a power cable to your ignition power (not straight to the battery).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first few days are going to hurt. Your body&amp;#039;s not used to that much riding and your muscles will be pissed. After a few days your body adapts. After the first week, you feel like you could ride for 8 hours a day indefinitely. At that point you start becoming one with the bike.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Having highway bars, or any sort of &amp;quot;alternate&amp;quot; position helps. It lets you shift around your body to prevent it from getting stiff. Highway bars also let you work on your flexibility while enduring long straightaways. You&amp;#039;ll be touching your toes in no time!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get your bike tuned before you leave. Make sure the tech knows that the service needs to last at least another 4000 miles. That may affect the oil and tire suggestions they make.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bring good gear. Most important are a comfortable helmet and good goggles (if wearing a shorty). Also very important are comfortable and versatile gloves. They&amp;#039;ll keep your fingers warm (motor control is important!) and protect from surprise rocks and insects. You will always be wearing them, even when riding through burning deserts with your jacket bungee&amp;#039;d onto the back of the bike.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Layer to stay warm. That includes your legs (thermal underwear for cold days). Good boots and athletic wool socks can cover an amazingly broad range of weather conditions. A pair of sandals for when you&amp;#039;re off the bike can be a nice change of pace.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pack less than you think you&amp;#039;ll need. You&amp;#039;re leaving the civilized world. There&amp;#039;s nothing wrong with wearing the same pair of jeans for a week... or two. Shirts can be worn more than once if you d&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put together a few basic tools that could help you in a pinch. Crescent wrench, hex key set (know your bike for metric vs SA), a philips and flathead screwdriver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Psychologically:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Realize that your state isn&amp;#039;t permanent and just enjoy the journey. How often do you get an extended chunk of time where you can literally float in the wind? Feel free to adjust your timing and route based upon whatever the hell you feel like doing. That&amp;#039;s true freedom.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#039;t even think about routines. Go to bed when you like, wake up when you like, go where you want to go, explore whatever is interesting, talk to anybody that seems friendly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I listened to music in one ear for the first week of the trip. I thought it would keep me from getting bored. Stopping that was the best decision I made on the trip. It takes a while to get used to silence (minus the engine and the wind), but it makes you think to fill in those gaps. That time available to truly think and reflect was a growing period of my life. When you have nothing but time, you&amp;#039;re free to turn over the stones of your life, re-examine everything, and chart your future course.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Much of the trip was very meditative. I would call people at night to catch up, but most of the days were spent reflecting, or just zoning out and taking in the amazing world around me. America is truly diverse, and you&amp;#039;d be amazed just how captivating the land can be.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Re-integration was pretty weird. Over the course of the trip, I got into the habit of starting a conversation with whomever was within talking distance of me. After that much time alone in the saddle, any human interaction was appreciated, even for an introvert. It was also a great way of getting to know about the areas and tapping into local America. In major cities, that sort of behavior (talking with everybody) can get you some pretty suspicious responses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the flip side, I got very comfortable with realllllly long silences. You forget that most people get uncomfortable if the conversation goes silent and you just let it stay that way. You cease to realize that the beautiful silence that you&amp;#039;re sharing with that person is probably being experienced in a very different (and probably more awkward) way by them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I have a whole book&amp;#039;s worth of thoughts on the topic, so feel free to ask away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&amp;#039;re thinking about taking a solo trip like this, just commit and do it. It will be an immensely rewarding experience on just about every level of your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Travel/What-should-I-keep-in-mind-when-planning-a-cross-country-trip-on-a-motorcycle"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">5:7c41fdd6c99608404c69d87eb858c18a#1351806175443309</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Nov 2012 21:42:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What are some stupid reasons for getting fired?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/Jobs-1/What-are-some-stupid-reasons-for-getting-fired/answer/Michael-O-Church</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In Jobs: Samuel Clay voted up an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_238"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_m9VmJG2_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_m9VmJG2_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/Michael-O-Church" routing="q://user/(2038726)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_m9VmJG2_link"&gt;Michael O.

I can tell a few of both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stupid employee: &lt;/b&gt;I&amp;#039;ve seen dumbasses get themselves fired for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;spending $2 million (out of $13 million total) in VC money on a launch party. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;hitting on his boss&amp;#039;s wife, in his house, drunk on liquor that he stole from his boss. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;using an MRI machine to wipe a hard drive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;playing the same song on the radio for 4 hours.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the obvious stupid shit (stealing, teachers fucking students, incompetence, drugs) that&amp;#039;s too common to mention. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stupid company/boss:&lt;/b&gt; many of these weren&amp;#039;t at places I&amp;#039;ve worked (but some were).

It is staring us in the face. It is still in its infancy, still drifting clumsily about in its primeval soup, but already it is achieving evolutionary change at a rate that leaves the old gene panting far behind. The new soup is the soup of human culture. We need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation. &amp;#039;Mimeme&amp;#039; comes from a suitable Greek root, but I want a monosyllable that sounds a bit like &amp;#039;gene&amp;#039;. I hope my classicist friends will forgive me if I abbreviate mimeme to meme.

Over the course of a few hundred interviews, this interview question has given me a sense of what good engineers look for and what they&amp;#039;re trying to avoid. I also reflected back on my own experiences from the past six years working across Google, Ooyala, and Quora and distilled some things that a team can do to build a good engineering culture:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Optimize for iteration speed.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick iteration speed increases work motivation and excitement. Infrastructural and bureaucratic barriers to deploying code and launching features are some of the most common and frustrating reasons that engineers cite during interviews for why they&amp;#039;re leaving their current companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organizationally, quick iteration speed means giving engineers and designers flexibility and autonomy to make day-to-day decisions without asking for permission. While I was at Google, any user-visible change to search results, even for low-traffic experiments, required Marissa Mayer&amp;#039;s approval at a weekly UI review. Needless to say, while this allowed Google to protect its search brand, it significantly hampered innovation. Optimizing for iteration speed also means that there are well-defined processes for launching products, so that cancellations don&amp;#039;t happen unexpectedly after significant time investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Infrastructurally, optimizing for iteration speed means building out continuous deployment with a fast deployment process, high test coverage to reduce build and site breakages, fast unit tests so that people run them, and fast and incremental compiles and reloads to reduce development time. Continuous deployment, where commits go immediately to production, deserves a special mention. Prior to using it at Quora, it would&amp;#039;ve been hard for me to internalize that the benefits it provides toward iteration speed outweigh the risks of site breakages, at least for small engineering teams. People are more excited about features and incentivized to fix bugs because changes see live traffic quickly. It&amp;#039;s also significantly easier to reason about and pinpoint the source of errors for a narrow window of committed code rather a week or more&amp;#039;s worth of batched changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Team-wise, fast iteration speed means having a set of strong leaders to help coordinate and drive team efforts. Key stakeholders in a decision need to decide effectively and commit to their choices. To borrow a phrase from Bill Walsh, a leader who coached the 49ers to 3 Super Bowls, strong leaders need to &amp;quot;commit, explode, recover,&amp;quot; which means committing to a plan of attack, executing it, and then reacting to the results.&amp;nbsp; A team crippled with indecisiveness will just cause individual efforts to flounder. [1]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Push relentlessly toward automation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his tech talk &amp;quot;Scaling Instagram&amp;quot;, Instagram co-founder &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="/Mike-Krieger"&gt;Mike Krieger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cited &amp;quot;optimize for minimal operational burden&amp;quot; as a key lesson his 13-person team learned in scaling the product to tens of millions of users. [2] As a product grows, so does the operational burden per engineer, as measured by the ratio of users to engineers or of features to engineers.&amp;nbsp; Facebook, for example, is well-known for touting scaling metrics like supporting over 1 million users per engineer. [3]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Automating solutions and scripting repetitive tasks are important because they free up the engineering team to work on the actual product. Ensuring that services restart automatically if possible when they fail and that services are easily and quickly replicated at peak traffic is the only sane way to manage complexity at scale. In the short-term, there&amp;#039;s always the tempting tradeoff of applying a quick band-aid manually rather than automating and testing a long-term fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Etsy&amp;#039;s motto of &amp;quot;measure anything, measure everything&amp;quot; [4] and its support of open-source monitoring and charting tools like graphite [5] and statsd [6] highlight an important aspect of automation -- that automation must be driven by data and monitoring. Without monitoring and logs to know what, how, or why something is going wrong, automation is difficult. A good follow-up motto would be to &amp;quot;measure anything, measure everything, and automate as much as possible.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Build the right software abstractions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MIT Professor Daniel Jackson captures the importance of software abstractions well [7]:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;quot;Pick the right ones, and programming will flow naturally from design; modules will have small and simple interfaces; and new functionality will more likely fit in without extensive reorganization. Pick the wrong ones, and programming will be a series of nasty surprises: interfaces will become baroque and clumsy as they are forced to accommodate unanticipated interactions, and even the simplest of changes will be hard to make.&amp;quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of what allowed thousands of engineers to build scalable systems at Google is that really smart engineers like Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat built simple but versatile abstractions like MapReduce [8], SSTable [9], protocol buffers [10], and the like. Part of what allowed Facebook engineering to scale up is the focus on similarly core abstractions like Thrift [11], Scribe [12], and Hive [13].&amp;nbsp; And part of what allows designers to build products effectively at Quora is that Webnode and Livenode [14] are fairly easy to understand and build on top of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping core abstractions simple and general reduces the need for custom solutions and increases the team&amp;#039;s familiarity and expertise with the common abstractions. The growing popularity and reliability of systems like Memcached, Redis, MongoDB, etc. have reduced the need to build custom storage and caching systems. Funneling the team&amp;#039;s focus onto a small number of core abstractions rather than fragmenting it over many ad-hoc solutions means that common libraries get more robust, monitoring gets more intelligent, performance characteristics get better understood, and tests get more comprehensive. All of this helps contribute to a simpler system with reduced operational burden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Develop a focus on high code quality with code reviews.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintaining a high-quality code base increases the productivity of the entire engineering team. Cleaner code is easier to reason about, quicker to develop on, more amenable to changes, and less susceptible to bugs. A healthy code review process makes this possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Establishing a process for timely code reviews, whether pre-commit or post-commit, improves code quality in a few ways.&amp;nbsp; First, the peer pressure of knowing that someone will be reviewing your code and that committing poorly written code will likely let down your teammates is a strong deterrent against hacky, unmaintainable, or untested code. Second, code reviews provide opportunities for the code reviewer and author to learn from each other to write better code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the code reviews are easily accessible to other members of the engineering team, then the reviews also bring along the benefits of a) increasing accountability for reviewing code in a timely manner, b) allowing team members -- particularly, newer ones -- to model off of others&amp;#039; good code reviews, and c) speeding up the dissemination of best coding practices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Counter-arguments that nimble teams don&amp;#039;t have time to spend on code reviews ignore the technical debt that can easily accumulate from poorly written code. Ooyala, in its very early startup days, used to optimize for cranking out as many features as possible, with an absence of code reviews; the result was that while the initial product may have gone to market more quickly, the resultant code became painful to modify, and we spent over a year just rewriting brittle code to eliminate technical debt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google, at its size, does pre-commit code reviews for all code, but smaller teams don&amp;#039;t need to be as comprehensive or strict, and not all code needs to be reviewed with the same rigor. Ooyala later adopted post-commit reviews over email for core or risky changes while I was there. At Quora, we currently conduct all code reviews in Phabricator [15], mostly post-commit, and apply different standards for model or controller code and view code; for sensitive code or for code from newer engineers, we&amp;#039;ll either do pre-commit reviews or try to review them within a few hours of the code being submitted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Maintain a respectful work environment.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Respect among peers forms the foundation for any type of open communication. A place where people feel comfortable challenging each other&amp;#039;s ideas is one where sound ideas get forged through debate. A place where people easily get offended is one where crucial feedback gets withheld.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1948, Alex Osborn outlined the familiar brainstorming approach that&amp;#039;s been popular in work environments for the past few decades, where participants come together, set aside criticism and negative feedback, and collectively pool together creative ideas without fear of being judged. [16] Respectful deferment of judgment is key to this type of brainstorming session. Recent psychology research has started to overturn Osborn&amp;#039;s approach, suggesting that encouraging debate in brainstorming sessions actually helps to avoid groupthink and generates more effective ideas. In light of this research, a respectful environment becomes even more critical so that attacks are directed toward ideas rather than being ad-hominem. [17]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Engineering often spans a wide range of areas (systems, machine learning, product, etc.) and not everyone has the same expertise in each area. A strong team in fact probably ought to have individuals who are uniquely strong in certain areas even if they end up being deficient in others. This sometimes makes it tricky for say, a systems engineer to evaluate the proficiency of a product engineer, but it&amp;#039;s important in a healthy engineering culture to respect those differences and to not judge solely based on your own strengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Build shared ownership of code.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&amp;#039;s natural for individuals to become proficient in various parts of the code base or infrastructure, no one person should feel that they own or are the sole maintainer of any one piece. While having individuals become experts that own certain areas for a year or more might increase effectiveness in the short run, this approach ends up hurting in the long run. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organizationally, shared code ownership provides three benefits. First, keeping the bus factor [18] greater than one relieves stress from the maintainer and reduces risk for the team in case the maintainer leaves. It also makes it difficult for that one person to take worry-free time off. I sure don&amp;#039;t miss the days when I was the sole maintainer of Ooyala&amp;#039;s logs processor and got texted by pager alerts while hiking on volcanoes in Hawaii.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, shared ownership empowers engineers who aren&amp;#039;t knee-deep in the particular area to contribute fresh insights. It frees engineers from the sense that they&amp;#039;re stuck on certain projects and encourages them to work on a diversity of projects, which helps to keep work interesting and boosts employee learning and motivation. In the long run, it reduces organizational risk that some engineer feels stagnated and decides to leave. [19]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, shared ownership also sets the foundation for having multiple team members swarm (a technique from agile development) together on a high-priority problem when necessary to finish a strategic goal more quickly. With siloed ownership, the burden typically falls on one or two people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One mistake that many engineering organizations make too early on is dividing the entire team into subteams with tech leads when the team&amp;#039;s still small. Subteams build walls of ownership that reduce incentive to cross those walls, since individuals will likely be assessed by their subteam&amp;#039;s objectives. Ooyala had subteams while I was there, and one thing I missed out on was the opportunity to work with some folks on other teams; they&amp;#039;ve since adopted an agile development process with a much larger focus on shared code ownership that I&amp;#039;ve heard has made large strides in work happiness and productivity. One aspect of Quora that I&amp;#039;ve loved is that we&amp;#039;ve emphasized projects over teams, and I&amp;#039;ve had an opportunity to work on projects ranging from user growth, machine learning, moderation tools, recommendations, analytics, site speed, and spam detection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Invest in automated testing.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unit test coverage and some degree of integration test coverage is the only scalable way of managing a large codebase with a large group of people without constantly breaking the build or the product. Automated testing provides confidence in and meaningful protection against large-scale refactorings that are required to improve code quality. In the absence of rigorous automated testing, the time required for manual testing either by the engineering team or by an outsourced testing team easily becomes prohibitive, and it&amp;#039;s easy to fall into a culture of fear for improving a piece of code just because it might break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In practice, automated testing is a requirement for making continuous deployment work as the team grows. Codebase size grows over time as the product grows, but average familiarity with the codebase by team members decreases as new people join. Testing and validation are most easily done by the original code authors when the code is fresh in their minds than by those who try to modify the code months or years later. Encouraging a strong unit testing culture shifts the validation responsibility toward the authors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Allot 20% time.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gmail found its roots in Paul Buchheit&amp;#039;s 20% project, and he hacked together the first version in a single day. [20] Google News, Google Transit, and Google Suggest also started and launched as 20% projects. I used 20% time while at Google to write a python framework that made it significantly easier to build search page demos.&amp;nbsp; While Google&amp;#039;s 20% time may be less productive now than during the early days of the company [21], the notion of letting engineers spend 20% of their time working on something not on their product map remains a cradle of innovation for smaller engineering organizations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ooyala didn&amp;#039;t officially have 20% time while I was there, but I took some anyway and wrote a command-line build tool for Flex and Actionscript that sped up the team&amp;#039;s build times, just as Adobe&amp;#039;s Flex Builder tool chain started to degrade, and the tool&amp;#039;s still in use today even though the engineering team has nearly tripled in size. Atlassian adopted 20% time after experimenting it for year. [22] A variation of 20% time that Facebook&amp;#039;s fond of and that Ooyala added later is periodic hackathons -- all-night events where the rule is that you can work on anything except your normal project. [23]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top-down approaches to product planning, while necessary for focusing the overall direction of the company, can&amp;#039;t account to for the multitude of ideas that might arise from engineers closer to the ground. As long as engineers are accountable for their 20% time and focus on what can be high-impact changes, these projects can lead to large steps forward in progress. Without official 20% time, it&amp;#039;s still possible but much more difficult for engineers and designers to try out crazy ideas -- the dedicated ones basically have to find weekends or vacation days to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Build a culture of learning and continuous improvement.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Learning and being sufficiently challenged are requirements for what psychology professor Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls a state of &amp;quot;flow&amp;quot;, where someone is so completely focused and motivated by what they&amp;#039;re doing that they even lose track of time. [24] The direct and immediate feedback loop provided by faster iteration cycles is another requirement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weekly tech talks provide forums for engineers to share their designs or what they&amp;#039;ve built, creating an opportunity for engineers to take pride in their work and for the team to learn more outside their immediate scope of work.&amp;nbsp; Documenting processes internally like how a email service works or how to make ranking changes to a search service also empowers engineers to learn and explore new things on their own, nicely complementing 20% time.&amp;nbsp; At Quora, we do this by running an internal instance of Quora where we ask product- and development-related questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A corollary of building a culture of learning is focusing on mentoring and training to make sure that everyone has the basic algorithms, systems, and product skills necessary for success.&amp;nbsp; The more an engineering organization grows and the more effort gets spent on recruiting (particularly college recruiting), the more effort needs to be invested into mentoring and training. It might seem burdensome for a single mentor to spend an hour per day for a new hire&amp;#039;s first 4 weeks on the job, but that investment represents less than 1% of the total time that hire will spend in a year and has significantly high leverage in determining whether the person is set up for success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Hire the best.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hiring the best is the foundation for many of the other philosophies listed. It&amp;#039;s hard to respect someone if you think they&amp;#039;re a B-level engineer. It&amp;#039;s hard to give someone autonomy in product development if you don&amp;#039;t trust their product instincts. It&amp;#039;s hard to recognize the right abstraction to build without enough engineering experience. It&amp;#039;s easy to fall into a trap of building something complex without other smart people to challenge your ideas and drive you toward simplicity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&amp;#039;s a saying around Silicon Valley, coined by Steve Jobs, that &amp;quot;A players hire A players. B players hire C players.&amp;quot; [25,26]&amp;nbsp; Focusing on recruiting and hiring the right people is hard but critical to effectively growing an engineering organization.&amp;nbsp; &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="/Yishan-Wong"&gt;Yishan Wong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, who previously was an engineering manager and director at Facebook, argued that hiring has to be the number one priority for everyone in the engineering organization, not just for managers, but for engineers as well. [27]&amp;nbsp; He also quite rightly points out the difference between &amp;quot;hiring the best&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hiring the best candidate that you&amp;#039;ve interviewed.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the early days of Ooyala, we were so overwhelmed with the queue of inbound customer work that we nearly caved in to lowering our hiring bar so that we could hire enough people to get all our work done.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;#039;m glad that we didn&amp;#039;t, as the technical debt from lower quality code and weaker engineers on the team would&amp;#039;ve ended up hurting the team and the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Building a good engineering culture is certainly a lot of work, but the resulting work environment is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more posts like this, follow &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://effectivehabits.quora.com"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Effective Habits&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[1] Bill Walsh.

comprises just 0.08% (that&amp;#039;s 8 one-hundredths of one percent) of all of Earth history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, if you were to consider just the &amp;quot;interesting parts,&amp;quot; i.e. dinosaurs onwards, human history still comprises only 2% of that timespan.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The graphic further uses a fairly generous definition of &amp;quot;human history,&amp;quot; i.e. the last 4 million years.&amp;nbsp; If we think of real human civilization as reasonably well-recorded history, we&amp;#039;re restricted to the last 4000-5000 years.&amp;nbsp; Once again, even when considered against the timescale of dinosaur existence, we&amp;#039;re a mere eyeblink in history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider also, that potentially millions or even &lt;i&gt;billions&lt;/i&gt; of years of history lie ahead of us.&amp;nbsp; Certainly the sun will last another ~5 billion years, and assuming no catastrophic scenario, that&amp;#039;s a lot more history.&amp;nbsp; Not to speak of any post-Earth pan-galactic or extra-galactic history - that&amp;#039;s even more &lt;i&gt;billions of years&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when it comes to time travelers coming to visit &amp;quot;our period,&amp;quot; we are talking about, at most, a 5000-year period out of billions.&amp;nbsp; Colloquially-speaking, you&amp;#039;re probably really only thinking of the last 200 years as &amp;quot;our period,&amp;quot; further narrowing the window to something practically infinitesimal.&amp;nbsp; When Time-Traveling Future Man is spinning the little time-destination dial to decide where to go on his time-travel backpacking adventure, our entire &amp;quot;period&amp;quot; is probably smaller than one little &amp;quot;tick&amp;quot; in the dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think about what you do when you travel, geographically-speaking.&amp;nbsp; You typically visit only three types of locations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Culturally-significant, metropolitan locations where lots of people can be encountered in a dense area, increasing personal transaction volume.&amp;nbsp; Big, interesting cities, like New York, London, Tokyo, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vacation locales, typically areas with exceptional climates.&amp;nbsp; Cabo San Lucas or Hawaii, those sorts of places.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extremely remote locales, untouched by human presence and notable primarily for their natural, unspoiled beauty.&amp;nbsp; Alaska, a national park, an African safari, perhaps even Antarctica.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our time period is a time period that is none of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are certainly not a time-travel metropolis - I imagine such a time period would be a central &amp;quot;New York&amp;quot;-esque base of operations for time travelers and time travel operations.&amp;nbsp; We certainly don&amp;#039;t have that in our day and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likewise, we are not a time of unspoiled natural beauty.&amp;nbsp; If a time traveler wanted that, there are hundreds of millions of years of dinosauria or other prehistoric periods they could journey to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#039;m not sure what a time-travel &amp;quot;vacation locale&amp;quot; would be, but presumably climate is not something you time travel for, so maybe there is no equivalent.&amp;nbsp; The Earth was certainly a lot warmer in the distant past, so maybe there are a few million years in the Cretaceous with a dinosaur-proof resort somewhere.&amp;nbsp; There&amp;#039;s certainly no point in traveling to the present time where all the good beachfront property has already been occupied by the &amp;quot;locals.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, instead, the current period is probably the temporal equivalent of flyover country.&amp;nbsp; You might say, &amp;quot;What do you mean, it&amp;#039;s a time of unprecedented technological and cultural change!&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; Maybe so, you time-hick, but a small town in South Dakota that&amp;#039;s finally getting hooked up to teh internet or getting their first Olive Garden isn&amp;#039;t interesting to someone who &lt;i&gt;already has&lt;/i&gt; ultra-fast broadband or lots of family-owned local Italian restaurants.&amp;nbsp; You have to remember that these are people from the future.&amp;nbsp; There&amp;#039;s nothing interesting to see here that they don&amp;#039;t already have.&amp;nbsp; They have technology and civil rights and cuisine that you and I can&amp;#039;t even begin to imagine.&amp;nbsp; You don&amp;#039;t visit small towns unless you have family still living there, and when it comes to time travel, family doesn&amp;#039;t really work that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the likely reason that time travelers from the future aren&amp;#039;t visiting our period is (other than time travel perhaps being physically impossible) that we&amp;#039;re just not that interesting, and we&amp;#039;re &lt;i&gt;not really that large&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#039;s only temporal-centric egotism that makes us believe otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Time-Travel/Why-are-people-from-the-future-not-time-traveling-to-our-period"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">5:1d5ae60bba335944473ebe7387035bee#1350607693574775</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Oct 2012 00:48:13 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Why are people from the future not time traveling to our period?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/Time-Travel/Why-are-people-from-the-future-not-time-traveling-to-our-period</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In Time Travel: Samuel Clay followed a question.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_243"&gt;&lt;span id="ld_bcivwu_244"&gt;94 Answers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Time-Travel/Why-are-people-from-the-future-not-time-traveling-to-our-period"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">1:3ff3b639be73d2c261706a5121f28091#1350607366903830</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Oct 2012 00:42:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Is getting rich worth it?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/Wealth/Is-getting-rich-worth-it/answer/Paul-Buchheit</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In Wealth: Samuel Clay voted up an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_245"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold;

Whether that&amp;#039;s a good thing or a bad thing depends on the extent to which you needed those constraints. If you have a serious alcohol or other drug addiction, wealth could be fatal for you. In general, it makes people more of whatever they already were. If you&amp;#039;re an asshole, getting more money will probably make you more of an asshole. However, if you have purpose and meaning in your life that goes beyond chasing the golden carrot, money can give you the freedom to focus on the things that truly matter to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the biggest dangers of wealth is that it often causes people to cut themselves off from the larger society, either out of fear or the belief that they are somehow better than others.

I wanted to get rich and I did it. But I actually feel maybe it&amp;#039;s not worth it. A slower path to wealth might be a lot healthier to my career and to my life in general. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four things stand out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sloth&lt;/b&gt; Work is no longer necessary. I can do anything I feel like but I end up doing mostly nothing and spend the days browsing the internet and writing as Anon User on Quora. Plus, the fact that I can just pay to get out of most of the situations makes me lazy and un-resourceful.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Greed &lt;/b&gt;I have a lot of money, but I crave for more. I want to be a hecto-millionaire now. But in the mean time, I don&amp;#039;t feel like working.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Entitlement &lt;/b&gt;I feel I deserve the BEST of everything, because I paid for it: $1000 a night for a hotel suite, $500 for a Michelin 3 star meal, and $1000 for a bottle of wine. I grow really angry if I don&amp;#039;t feel I am treated like royalty. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Loss of Purpose &lt;/b&gt;I feel my life/career has peaked. I don&amp;#039;t know what I am supposed to do now. What&amp;#039;s the purpose? I can go do some charity work, but this is not intellectually stimulating and most non-profits are run by a bunch of bozos anyway.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I would have been a better individual if I didn&amp;#039;t make the money, stayed in a corporate job and just been a &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; person.&amp;nbsp; But it&amp;#039;s impossible to give up the money. Being wealthy is probably not worth it. But once you get there, you want to stay there forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Wealth/Is-getting-rich-worth-it"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">5:48e6ab4e487c9b6a2f5f4ec7eda80c8f#1350408724344801</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2012 17:32:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Which payment provider is advisable for startup businesses: PayPal or Stripe?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/Payment-Processing/Which-payment-provider-is-advisable-for-startup-businesses-PayPal-or-Stripe/answer/Samuel-Clay</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In Payment Processing: Samuel Clay added an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_247"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_aWzvK58_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_aWzvK58_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/Samuel-Clay" routing="q://user/(12196)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_aWzvK58_link"&gt;Samuel Clay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My startup NewsBlur, an RSS news reader, uses both Paypal and Stripe for payment processing. I integrated Paypal two years ago and then Stripe.js about six months ago, so I have some experience with both. I&amp;#039;m using both payment providers for subscriptions, so I charge my users a recurring fee to use NewsBlur. This has some disadvantages since I&amp;#039;m not just making a one-time charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&amp;#039;s my breakdown of pros and cons of both services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Paypal Pros&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Name recognition - everybody knows it so they know what they are paying with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;User accounts - many people already have accounts on Paypal, so they don&amp;#039;t need to enter in their credit card.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integration - Pre-built Django apps meant that in order to accept real-time payment notifications (Paypal&amp;#039;s IPN), all I had to do was install the app and write signal hook-ups to handle payments, refunds, cancellations, and subscription lapses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sandbox - Debugging and development was pretty easy, although it did take 2x as long as Stripe.js&amp;#039;s development took. This is entirely due to Stripe.js superior interface.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Paypal Cons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reputation - A not-insignificant number of users dislike Paypal and refused to pay for NewsBlur until there was an alternative provider.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Payouts - In order to get money from Paypal, I have to login each month and transfer funds to my bank. Not a huge hurdle, but this should be automatic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Holding times - Paypal holds funds for longer than Stripe does. And occasionally they will hold funds for longer as a user may dispute the charge. If I were running a business where I couldn&amp;#039;t make payroll because Paypal is holding onto my money, I would be rightfully pissed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;History - Searching through my history, whether it&amp;#039;s to investigate a payment, issue a refund, or cross-reference payments, is a pain in the butt. I have to generate a report specified over dates instead of just browse through an infinite scroll of payments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stripe Pros&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;History - A modern dashboard means I can issue refunds and find specific payments within seconds, as opposed to dedicating a few minutes to getting Paypal to cooperate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Payment times - Stripe funnels money into my bank account every day, so there&amp;#039;s no need to log in and make a manual transaction every months or so. Definitely preferred over Paypal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Modern dashboard - Using Stripe for both development and production has been eased considerably by their Backbone.js-backed interface, so performing actions is far easier than Paypal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support - For the few times I&amp;#039;ve needed to talk with Stripe&amp;#039;s support, I&amp;#039;ve had their engineers within hours. Incredible for the not at all high volume I&amp;#039;m doing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integration - Pre-built Django apps made integration with my existing stack easy. All I had to do was hook up the real-time signals and write my credit card form template. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stripe Cons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;User accounts - The lack of user accounts is something I believe is going to be addressed. But for now, users have to enter in a credit card number instead of just a username and password.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using both services for a number of months and for a few thousand paying customers, I can recommend Stripe.js without hesitation, although supporting both has meant that I can accept payments from as wide a net as possible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, Stripe provides a much cleaner path to integration, with their clear documentation, modern dashboard, and developing community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Payment-Processing/Which-payment-provider-is-advisable-for-startup-businesses-PayPal-or-Stripe"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">5:b836529d3876ec80e2b83734029cb3d0#1349805228319322</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Oct 2012 17:53:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Are there any jobs for CS Majors that don't require full-time programming?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/Jobs-1/Are-there-any-jobs-for-CS-Majors-that-dont-require-full-time-programming/answer/Nick-Nguyen</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In Jobs: Samuel Clay voted up an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_248"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_CJ9XM4r_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_CJ9XM4r_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/Nick-Nguyen" routing="q://user/(995)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_CJ9XM4r_link"&gt;Nick Nguyen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a product manager with a CS degree, I heartily recommend starting out with a programming job.&amp;nbsp; That&amp;#039;s exactly what I did, the first half of my career was almost exclusively technical, and, like you, I didn&amp;#039;t really enjoy programming in college.&amp;nbsp; It wasn&amp;#039;t until I started working that coding really started to appeal to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of it was confidence- I didn&amp;#039;t think I had the technical chops to program for a living, but when I was thrown into the crucible of consulting, I found that building real things for real clients was a totally different ballgame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&amp;#039;m a product guy at my own startup, having a technical background helps me contribute in a way that I couldn&amp;#039;t if I didn&amp;#039;t know how to program.

And the reasons for which his behavior would be deemed rational would also make it practically impossible for you to prove that it is unsafe in court.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Statistically speaking (which, frankly, is what matters) it is more irresponsible for you to take your child places in your car than it is for your ex to put him on public transportation. The odds of you getting into a car accident (whether your fault or the other driver&amp;#039;s) are &lt;b&gt;incredibly more likely&lt;/b&gt; to happen than a kidnapping or any other conceivable mishap via public transportation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People&amp;#039;s perception of the unsafeness of public transportation is driven largely by (i) the fact that public transportation was less safe decades ago and (ii) the media&amp;#039;s unrelenting coverage of incredibly rare events like kidnappings by strangers (which is one of the key fears parents have when it comes to their children and public transportation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, not only is your son&amp;#039;s use of public transportation safe, but it is also &lt;b&gt;good&lt;/b&gt; for him and for you. It will instill a sense of independence, confidence, and competence in your child as well as put your fears into perspective and make you a less worrisome person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The one caveat here is if either end of your son&amp;#039;s commute is in a high crime area, then public transportation may not be a good idea. But there are several indicators here that lead me to believe that this is not the case.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Parenting/Is-it-legal-for-my-ex-to-force-our-12-year-old-son-to-take-public-transportation-to-school-and-athletic-practices"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">5:eed05cc6a741af3298e0eb1dd9458fa3#1344368668306528</guid><pubDate>Tue, 07 Aug 2012 19:44:28 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What will be the next big trend on the Internet after "search" of Google and "social" of Facebook?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/Technology-Trends/What-will-be-the-next-big-trend-on-the-Internet-after-search-of-Google-and-social-of-Facebook/answer/David-Galbraith</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In Technology Trends: Samuel Clay voted up an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_250"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_EWml8nP_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_EWml8nP_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/David-Galbraith" routing="q://user/(127285)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_EWml8nP_link"&gt;David Galbraith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Search was for reading, Facebook is for reading and writing. Curation will give you what to read or write or buy or sell. It will lead to the mother of all &amp;#039;middle man&amp;#039; disintermediation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The internet is a distributed computer, it does three things: write, crunch and read and these have three parameters immediacy, symmetry &amp;amp; relevancy (who is doing the reading and writing and when and whats the value add [relevancy]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The early web was highly asymmetric (more people browsed than published) - creating opportunity for Google to help people find things. Blogging made publishing easier (web becoming more symmetric) and opened the ecosystem for things like Facebook. Increasing symmetry and mobile access also increased immediacy - the real time web.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the middle of the read/write process is the crunching - the machine. This is where the value add happens and offline its where middle men sit. Online this stuff is still primitive, amazon recommendations, ebay reputation etc. Its primitive becuase the core reputation algorithms don&amp;#039;t differentiate between the connoisseurs and the gluttons, they don&amp;#039;t take into consideration the complexities of knowledge value add - the 501st review of a pizza joint on Yelp actually reduces the value of the aggregate because it reduces the signal to noise ratio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is where the meat is, all good Internet businesses are about disintermediating middle men. Offline, middle men (maybe it should be middle people), capture rents through hogging proprietary information. There are still realtors that take huge percentage of a transaction with very little value add compared to, say, an architect and retailers that do little more than assemble a collection of items in a shop window. They will eventually be killed by a medium which increases information liquidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best emerging term for the online middle man is the curator. In future, system will arise built around helping and automating curation, through heuristically derived algorithms (for example). This will create the opportunity for a platform built around curation and which represents a paradigm shift comparable to Google or Facebook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Technology-Trends/What-will-be-the-next-big-trend-on-the-Internet-after-search-of-Google-and-social-of-Facebook"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">5:4f414c90d54ba7a4987b7de5a786c399#1344368618073277</guid><pubDate>Tue, 07 Aug 2012 19:43:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What is the best way for a startup to attract talented back-end and front-end team members?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/Startups/What-is-the-best-way-for-a-startup-to-attract-talented-back-end-and-front-end-team-members/answer/Simon-Willison</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In Startups: Samuel Clay voted up an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_251"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_x5cfam2_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_x5cfam2_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/Simon-Willison" routing="q://user/(47509)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_x5cfam2_link"&gt;Simon Willison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, pay them properly. It&amp;#039;s a lot easier for a talented developer to chose a startup over an established company if they aren&amp;#039;t going to have to take a massive pay cut in exchange for equity (most developers are smart enough to know that most startups fail... especially developers who have been in the industry for a while). If you raise money from investors, this is what you should be raising it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assuming you&amp;#039;re not asking them to take a big pay cut, attracting them becomes easier (that&amp;#039;s not to say it&amp;#039;s easy). Developers want to ship high quality code, quickly, without all of the political bullshit that you get in larger companies. They want to work with (and learn from) other smart people, and they want to be able to strongly influence both technical and product decisions. They don&amp;#039;t want to be treated as drones and have specs thrown over the wall at them. They don&amp;#039;t want to spend all day in meetings. If you pay attention to your company culture this is an area you can absolutely compete with larger companies on - make it more interesting and more fun to be a developer at a startup than to go and join a larger organisation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Startups/What-is-the-best-way-for-a-startup-to-attract-talented-back-end-and-front-end-team-members"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">5:06f889ff18072fc19099694aab71c4fb#1344368466059813</guid><pubDate>Tue, 07 Aug 2012 19:41:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What does it feel like to hate everyone?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/What-Does-It-Feel-Like-to-X/What-does-it-feel-like-to-hate-everyone/answer/Mills-Baker</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In What Does It Feel Like to X?: Samuel Clay voted up an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_252"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_bzhYpTC_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_bzhYpTC_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/Mills-Baker" routing="q://user/(1072617)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_bzhYpTC_link"&gt;Mills Baker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feelings of superiority aren&amp;#039;t synonymous with self-esteem; they may in fact be reflections of its total absence. In any event, I&amp;#039;ve felt superior to most or all other people for periods in my past, and hated people —it embarrasses me to say now— for what I perceived as their dim brutality, meanness, imbecility, whatever. As uncomfortable as I am recalling these periods, I hope that they&amp;#039;re at least familiar in some analogous form to others from their own adolescences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you hate everyone, you suffer far more than they do. I remember feeling universally misunderstood, going through the day monitoring each interaction for proof of others&amp;#039; stupidity or malice, interpreting every social phenomenon in as paranoid and cynical a light as I could. Feeling superior in intelligence and morality, I sought and found evidence everywhere of two things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Others were fallible in unspeakable ways: timid and imitative, craven and approval-seeking, brutal and selfish, false, insincere, cruel and indifferent. Above all: they were self-serving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I was a different sort of person, made for a vastly kinder, juster, more sensible world; in this reality, at least, I was far above the median, which doomed my sensitive psyche to constant vexation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, one knows that one isn&amp;#039;t really superior; even very superior persons cannot sustain their pretense when alone for long without having to concede, at least, that they&amp;#039;re not &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; enough for the world to notice. If everyone is so inferior, what can account for one&amp;#039;s lack of total success? If one is superior, one&amp;#039;s performance ought to be superior, and one knows when one is making excuses for oneself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So hating everyone becomes, as always, a mirror for hating oneself: as one hates them for their stupidity, one feels one&amp;#039;s own pretense of intelligence to be a fraud, and the same is true for other attributes. One cannot help but admit, even if one manages to maintain real grandiosity, that &lt;i&gt;hating&lt;/i&gt; —a deeply unpleasant and unproductive and painful experience— is proof of one&amp;#039;s serious fallibility. One is always aware that one is wasting one&amp;#039;s time, energy, and life despising people who are not similarly tormented, who are enjoying their time. Even those foolish enough to feel superior are not foolish enough to miss that irony. We&amp;#039;ll&amp;nbsp; say: &amp;quot;Ignorance really does seem to be bliss.&lt;i&gt; [sigh]&amp;quot; &lt;/i&gt;But this is a little pose, a self-compliment we pay for no one&amp;#039;s benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum: it feels consuming, draining, useless, and awful, as it should. As a process, its basis is error —one isn&amp;#039;t superior, after all— and so it isn&amp;#039;t aligned accurately with reality and produces unsought outcomes; one is invariably unhappy, and nothing&amp;#039;s really more inferior than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/What-Does-It-Feel-Like-to-X/What-does-it-feel-like-to-hate-everyone"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.quora.com/What-Does-It-Feel-Like-to-X/What-does-it-feel-like-to-hate-everyone/answer/Mills-Baker#1343633787363318</guid><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2012 07:36:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What are some unusual work habits of famous writers?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-unusual-work-habits-of-famous-writers</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;Samuel Clay followed a question.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_253"&gt;&lt;span id="ld_bcivwu_254"&gt;10 Answers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-unusual-work-habits-of-famous-writers"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-unusual-work-habits-of-famous-writers#1343246723237349</guid><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jul 2012 20:05:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>If a large plane lands somewhere from which it's not able to take off again, how is the plane removed?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/Aviation/If-a-large-plane-lands-somewhere-from-which-its-not-able-to-take-off-again-how-is-the-plane-removed/answer/John-Collison</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In Aviation: Samuel Clay voted up an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_255"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_MLQAM4y_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_MLQAM4y_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/John-Collison" routing="q://user/(2822)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_MLQAM4y_link"&gt;John Collison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1983, a Mexican Gulfstream II (XA-FOU) made an emergency landing at Mallow racecourse in Cork, Ireland due to a fuel shortage.

All pretty decent, thankfully. But I&amp;#039;ve seen instances of more toxic examples of both from ringside seats. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#039;ll talk about the best reasons for such a move, rather than the typical ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Startups have very high variance and a long tail of &amp;quot;crappy.&amp;quot; Big companies, by virtue of having at least once discovered a workable business model, tend to have lower variance and lower likelihood of complete stupidity. Generally you&amp;#039;ll find at least a few smart people worth working with, real things to learn, less pressure, more freedom, opportunities to have huge impact etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am amused by startup types who assume by default that any startup is better than any big company. Hell no. I&amp;#039;d say 70% of startups are dumb cauldrons of overgrown children indulging themselves by wasting money and mistaking playtime for work. By contrast even the most Dilbertish big companies tend to have more self-awareness and a core of real value creation (even if only 20% of employees generate 80% of the value). Many diehard startup types project their own inability to leave playpen environments onto big companies, by making up cartoon villain models. People seem to forget that by definition, every big company was once a successful startup. They forget that most successful startups exit by being acquired by a big company. Curious disconnect. Not liking big companies is kinda like not liking where you&amp;#039;re trying very hard to go. Or kids never wanting to graduate school/college. Sitting on a beanbag sipping free gourmet coffee does not by itself make you more valuable and productive than sitting in a bad chair in a cubicle drinking bad coffee that you had to pay 10c for. Just more spoiled. Value is about what you do, not where you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mature people understand how the whole ecosystem works and see the value of working in each type of company. Though many may switch for practical reasons like pay or resume stuffing, I suspect the best switch out of a growing maturity, curiosity and wanting new kinds of experiences. They want to experience the &amp;quot;other side.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; Insisting on only working at startups is a Peter Pan pathology. Or like never traveling abroad because you think yours is the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; country. Since your chances of growing old along with a successful startup are small, you have to switch jobs to experience the full birth-death economic lifecycle of businesses. You will never experience the awe of being part of multi-billion dollar decisions at a scrappy startup, and that&amp;#039;s an experience worth having. A friend of mine at GE labs wrote code that immediately started saving millions per year in locomotive fuel costs. He was able to make an impact bigger than the funding of multiple startups. Startup ideologues just don&amp;#039;t get the kind of excitement that sort of thing can generate. Even working at dying, shrinking old companies is a very rewarding experience if you understand what there is to learn. Having to lay off 500 people or figuring out how to maximally harvest a dying end-of-life product are worthwhile growth experiences, believe it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For many people, big companies are actually the places where they can do the best work. For generations, the finest work used to come out of big company labs, not startups. Where do you think the transistor was invented?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dealing with some bureaucracy is often far easier than dealing with smug, self-important and big-ego founder types who rule small claustrophobic groups with tyranny and mistake an ability to raise money with good business skills. And you may be surprised to find that some of the most interesting, wisest people in the world can be found in bureaucracies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Examine your assumptions. The world is a bigger, more complex and more fascinating place than you&amp;#039;ve been led to believe by the jocks in the startup schoolyard who want to play high school quarterback their whole life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Startups/Why-do-employees-leave-startups-for-big-brands"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.quora.com/Startups/Why-do-employees-leave-startups-for-big-brands/answer/Venkatesh-Rao#1340055548702421</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jun 2012 21:39:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>How does A/B testing work when developing iPhone apps?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/A-B-Testing/How-does-A-B-testing-work-when-developing-iPhone-apps/answer/Eric-Florenzano</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In A/B Testing: Samuel Clay voted up an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_257"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_MKaPiRz_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_MKaPiRz_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/Eric-Florenzano" routing="q://user/(32334)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_MKaPiRz_link"&gt;Eric Florenzano&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main difference that we&amp;#039;ve found so far is that without some thought, it can be a slower iteration cycle because you have to push every test through the app store and wait for users to update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, we have found a partial solution to this issue, which is to pull down some data from the server and use that data to drive some portion of your tests.&amp;nbsp; Of course doing this naively (pulling down data on-demand) can negatively impact performance, so it&amp;#039;s more of an engineering challenge to get this right, which is why we haven&amp;#039;t heard as many people do it this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, that&amp;#039;s why we built what we call the &amp;quot;data-driven test&amp;quot; for &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://clutch.io/mobile-ab-testing" rel="nofollow" class="external_link" target="_blank" onmouseover="return require(&amp;quot;qtext&amp;quot;).tooltip(this, &amp;quot;clutch.io&amp;quot;)"&gt;clutch.io/mobile-ab-testi&lt;wbr /&gt;ng&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;nbsp; You give the framework a code block, which takes a dictionary as an argument, and then you parse out whatever data you&amp;#039;re interested in from that dictionary--it could be a color, some x and y co-ordinates, or button copy.&amp;nbsp; Then you can go and, on the server, create a bunch of different variations after-the-fact, without needing to re-release a new version each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&amp;#039;ve found that this data-driven approach is a good compromise between native performance, rapid test iteration, and sanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/A-B-Testing/How-does-A-B-testing-work-when-developing-iPhone-apps"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.quora.com/A-B-Testing/How-does-A-B-testing-work-when-developing-iPhone-apps/answer/Eric-Florenzano#1339540072508358</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jun 2012 22:27:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What does Douglas Crockford think of CoffeeScript?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/CoffeeScript/What-does-Douglas-Crockford-think-of-CoffeeScript/answer/Jeremy-Ashkenas</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In CoffeeScript: Samuel Clay voted up an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_258"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_U6PlF00_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_U6PlF00_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/Jeremy-Ashkenas" routing="q://user/(47866)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_U6PlF00_link"&gt;Jeremy Ashkenas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#039;ll let the man speak for himself. Here&amp;#039;s a quote from the Crockford on JavaScript lecture series, part 5:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;One of my favorites along those lines is a new little language called CoffeeScript, which takes the good parts -- not even all of the good parts, but a nice little language -- and comes up with groovy new syntax for it, which is minimal. It&amp;#039;s almost like dandelions: little fluffs of programs that do everything that conventional JavaScript programs do. You can&amp;#039;t do anything in that language that you can&amp;#039;t do in JavaScript, so it&amp;#039;s all cosmetic. I don&amp;#039;t know if all or much of that will find its way into JavaScript, because I&amp;#039;m not sure there&amp;#039;s enough of a payoff there.

But if you met us, you would never know it since we are extremely frugal. We grew up very modestly, and our parents taught us how to save and invest.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have a few rules in our house:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Give generously and invest in others&lt;/b&gt; - We donate a significant amount of money to charities.&amp;nbsp; We also have our children participate in selecting what to give to other children. It is part of our family life to help others since it makes them value what they have even more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Less is more -&lt;/b&gt; At the end of my child&amp;#039;s birthday party, he had over two dozen new toys. What child needs that many toys?&amp;nbsp; We let him select 2 toys, and we gave away the rest. We routinely cull our children&amp;#039;s toy boxes to keep their things to a minimum. One of the greatest predictors of success in life is the &amp;quot;marshmallow test&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; Deferred gratification is important, so we strive to teach our kids that. &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshmallow_test" class="external_link" target="_blank"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w&lt;wbr /&gt;iki/Mar...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;No extras&lt;/b&gt; - We do not have cable or netflix, a flat screen TV, or even a land line. We do not need those things to live.&amp;nbsp; We invest in education, extracurricular activities, and trips, but we try to avoid extra expenditures whenever possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reduce brands in the house - &lt;/b&gt;We buy modest things and whenever possibly, we do not go with brand name clothing, food, detergent etc. Our children&amp;#039;s clothes are all bought on sale, and we drive a simple car. Our last car was over a decade years old, and we basically drove it until it was on its last legs before buying another small sedan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Limit advertising &lt;/b&gt;- We severely limit access to television since there is a lot of marketing which drives acquisitiveness. We try to let the kids watch shows without licensing so they do not ask for the latest XYZ product.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;It may seem our children are deprived of many things, but rest assured, we live a rich life.&amp;nbsp; We invest in experiences and people, not things.&amp;nbsp; If all of the wealth went away tomorrow, our lives would not be that much different on a day-to-day basis. Our kids are happy and well-adjusted because they do not know any other life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/How-can-wealthy-families-teach-their-children-to-live-frugally"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.quora.com/How-can-wealthy-families-teach-their-children-to-live-frugally/answers/921458#1333850662998472</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Apr 2012 02:04:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What are some good hacks for renting an apartment in San Francisco?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/Real-Estate-in-San-Francisco/What-are-some-good-hacks-for-renting-an-apartment-in-San-Francisco/answer/Marcel-Molina</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In Real Estate in San Francisco: Samuel Clay voted up an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_263"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_HR9QhC4_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_HR9QhC4_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/Marcel-Molina" routing="q://user/(20879)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_HR9QhC4_link"&gt;Marcel Molina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What works most places doesn&amp;#039;t usually cut it in San Francisco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In most places you all but seal the deal by showing up with a recent pay stub, a pre-filled-out application, a full credit report (preferably from all three bureaus) and your checkbook to pay a deposit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In San Francisco, though, not only does everyone show up with the same high salary and credit score and everything filled out in triplicate all organized in a folder, but &lt;i&gt;dozens &lt;/i&gt;of people do. And they are all young and smart and friendly so you can&amp;#039;t expect to differentiate yourself on charm either. If you&amp;#039;re going to an open house you are probably already too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So since usually everyone ends up being equal, what I&amp;#039;ve observed is that &lt;b&gt;the person who usually ends up getting the place is simply the person who called first&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;quot;hack&amp;quot;, then, is simply to increase the odds that you&amp;#039;ll be the first person to call about a place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I did (you can do it any number of ways).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apartment listing places like Craigslist usually provide RSS feeds for searches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Route all your search feeds to a Twitter account using a service like &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitterfeed.com/" rel="nofollow" class="external_link" target="_blank"&gt;http://twitterfeed.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set up SMS notifications for the Twitter account so you are notified &lt;i&gt;immediately&lt;/i&gt; when a new listing appears&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Check the listing out immediately and if it seems worthwhile call immediately to set up a viewing as soon as possible&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/Real-Estate-in-San-Francisco/What-are-some-good-hacks-for-renting-an-apartment-in-San-Francisco"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.quora.com/Real-Estate-in-San-Francisco/What-are-some-good-hacks-for-renting-an-apartment-in-San-Francisco/answer/Marcel-Molina#1333515431592336</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Apr 2012 04:57:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Can a cogent argument be made that abortion is immoral?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/Abortion/Can-a-cogent-argument-be-made-that-abortion-is-immoral/answer/Mills-Baker</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;In Abortion: Samuel Clay voted up an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_264"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_pj1RMpC_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_pj1RMpC_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/Mills-Baker" routing="q://user/(1072617)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_pj1RMpC_link"&gt;Mills Baker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One possible argument: the destruction of what will become a knowledge-generating mind has unpredictable consequences which may very well exceed in impact the consequences of an unwanted birth [1]. Because any mind is capable of creatively contributing to the advance of the species, and because it is not presently possible to predict what sort of individual a fetus will become, one must take seriously that what is being destroyed is a uniquely configured computer with nearly infinite knowledge-generating potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be specious to say this ought to be a basis for legislation; it is both true and questionably relevant to say that any aborted fetus may have become civilization&amp;#039;s next Einstein or Curie or Tolstoy. It may also have become Stalin, but more probably it would have been an ordinary person without significant impact. But since we all agree that the question of the &amp;quot;significance&amp;quot; of any given impact is partially a subjective matter, this response to my proposed argument can be problematized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I am pro-choice for rather banal legal reasons having mostly to do with the sovereign agency all individuals must have over their own bodies, I consider this argument cogent: that abortion is the destruction, during installation, if you will, of a computer with universal reach and the capacity to creatively develop knowledge in ways we cannot predict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite apart from any individual experience, such as it might be, of either the fetus or the mother or parents, this is an impact at a social scale. Humanity is engaged in the constant development of solutions to problems introduced by previous solutions, our environment, and ourselves. To fail to solve significant problems means extinction. As David Deutsch says, &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Problems are inevitable. Problems are soluble.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt; Anything not prevented by the laws of physics is a matter of know-how alone, and as such you might argue that the consequences of losing an inimitably-configured iteration of the problem-solving human prototype —an individual— are so unpredictable as to be not worth it. After all, the &amp;quot;know-how&amp;quot; for a new form of literature, an important research development in green tech, or even a major breakthrough in the battle to end death might come from anyone. [2]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This answer provides little if any reassurance to a woman required to devote her body and mind to the arduous process of maternity against her will, of course. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[1]. I should like to emphasize again that I am &lt;i&gt;trying&lt;/i&gt; to conjure a cogent argument; I personally am unsympathetic to policies which ignore their human cost and the individual experiences they catalyze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[2].

I&amp;#039;ve also dissected 500+ emails from a recent seed round fundraising to map investor response. Here&amp;#039;s what I&amp;#039;ve learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through thousands of pitches, I&amp;#039;ve found that fewer that 5% tell a great traction story. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are 10 tips that can help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But first, let&amp;#039;s get one thing straight - this is the only thing that matters to investors:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="qtext_image zoomable_in zoomable_in_feed" src="http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9951cb7f05a3ac69fb56037f9c0e9f4c" master_src="http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-22a39a4d2617a3008f2ccbbd6bb439c7" master_w="1013" master_h="681"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Venture investors invest in momentum. Traction is your story of momentum. &lt;/b&gt;It&amp;#039;s told through quantified evidence of market demand for your product. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Here I&amp;#039;ll bring in Alec Baldwin for a little help. Remember ABC in Glengarry Glen Ross? Watch this: &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-AXTx4PcKI" class="external_link" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/wa&lt;wbr /&gt;tch?v=y...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Now think ASM: Always Show Momentum. That&amp;#039;s what this is all about. ASM.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1) Compress your X Axis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The X axis is how long you&amp;#039;ve been working. The shorter, the better. Consider two startups below, both at the same number of users:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="qtext_image zoomable_in zoomable_in_feed" src="http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d391fed503c19b129fc9c812f7e1aef6" master_src="http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4585cf9f145975b9f43f1272369429e5" master_w="1013" master_h="681"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an investor, who would you bet on? Blue, of course, because they&amp;#039;ve moved faster. So as a startup, how can you show that you&amp;#039;re moving fast? Set reference points to &lt;i&gt;effectively&lt;/i&gt; shorten the period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider these two messages, for the same consumer web product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;We started in 2008, and have 5000 users.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, an investor&amp;#039;s thinking: &amp;#039;5000 users/36 months = painfully slow growth.&amp;#039; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;We started to experiment in 2008. We built the alpha of our current product in late 2010, and just launched the beta in February. We already have 5000 users.&amp;quot; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, she&amp;#039;s likely to think &amp;#039;they took awhile to find the right fit, but now they&amp;#039;re moving fast - 5000 users in beta is pretty good!&amp;#039;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same progress, different message. Psychologically, you&amp;#039;re anchoring a better reference point in their minds. In the second example you&amp;#039;re anchoring them around the beta launch, not the beginning of your startup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More examples:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;We started experimenting with this in 2008, and took a year to understand the space. Last September we quit our jobs to build this full time. Since then, we&amp;#039;ve built the alpha and then launched a second beta version, now with 5000 users.&amp;quot; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&amp;#039;s anchoring them around the point that the team fully committed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;We started experimenting in 2008, and built a couple iterations of the product. We found product-market fit with this version in August, and are now in beta, with 5000 users.&amp;quot; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&amp;#039;s anchoring around this product version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2) Choose Your X Axis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&amp;#039;re adventurous try another X axis. Sales cycles can work where there&amp;#039;s a slow, well-known sales cycle, like education. For example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Adoption is doubling every four months.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&amp;#039;s pretty good, but this is better:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Adoption is doubling every term.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&amp;#039;s better because there&amp;#039;s probably only acquisition potential each new term, and you&amp;#039;re doubling users at every opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With very early products you can use product iteration. It works best with engagement or conversion numbers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#039;re currently converting 1.2% to paid users.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&amp;#039;s okay, but I&amp;#039;d love to hear how that has changed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;We were converting 0.3% to paid users in the first product iteration. We raised that to 0.6% with the second iteration, and our current version is converting at 1.2%.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here your X axis is product versions. This creates a nice trend line, and shows an investor that you&amp;#039;re learning and improving. I find this works well with accelerator startups, who are early but move quickly. It&amp;#039;s not traction in the true form (market demand), and shouldn’t displace a core metric, but it does show that your team can learn and execute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;3) Lower Expectations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may want to set expectations low, and then exceed them. The most obvious example is when you’re in beta - say it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;We have 200 users.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&amp;#039;s weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#039;re in closed beta, and have 200 users.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&amp;#039;s better. You&amp;#039;ve set the investor&amp;#039;s expectations low with a closed beta, so 200 seems normal. Now for bonus points, slip in some evidence of greater demand:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#039;re in closed beta with 200 users, but each user is inviting on average 4.5 new users, and our waiting list is over 1000.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy crap. The new message: there are only 200 users now, but they&amp;#039;re going crazy, and once they open you up it&amp;#039;ll explode!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another example I like, with product discovery: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Before we even built the back end, we put an embarrassingly simple site up, just to see if there was any interest. We were blown away by the response - 200 users in the first week!&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lower their expectations on the product side, then exceed it with the user response. (Some of the coolest products began with faked back ends.) This hints at product-market fit before you even had a real product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, set expectations by characterizing your users. This works best for enterprise or B2B startups, where customers are more difficult to win and have more value than consumer web. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;We have 400 customers, all of which are SMBs and have a projected lifetime value of $1500.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&amp;#039;re speaking to an investor more familiar with consumer internet, that will put it in perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;4) Choose Your Y Axis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Broadly, I find traction most convincing in the following order:&lt;br /&gt;- Profitability&lt;br /&gt;- Revenues&lt;br /&gt;- Active users&lt;br /&gt;- Registered users&lt;br /&gt;- Engagement&lt;br /&gt;- Partnerships/clients&lt;br /&gt;- Traffic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this changes depending on your product and market. Some examples that might work:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;E-commerce:&lt;/b&gt; revenue growth, average sales or gross margins, customers, average return visits per customer, units moved, and some industry specific numbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consumer internet:&lt;/b&gt; user numbers, engagement of those users (number of questions or answers, photo uploads, time on site, whatever is relevant), virality (average new invites per user, waiting lists, etc.) or partnerships (brands signed on, stores engaged, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;SaaS for small businesses:&lt;/b&gt; revenues, conversion to paid customers, registered users, cost of customer acquisition + lifetime customer value, signed distribution partners, or some quantifiable evidence of value to customers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enterprise:&lt;/b&gt; revenues, number of enterprise customers/clients, average contract size (growing?), qualified sales pipeline. Try to find some downstream value add example, say that your product engages X of their staff or customers, or saves them Y % on marketing costs while improving results. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pick the metrics that best tell the story of your momentum. There are many options - be imaginative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;5) Use Absolute and Growth Numbers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growth is key. You always want to tell that momentum story. Consider the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="qtext_image zoomable_in zoomable_in_feed" src="http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-27f721488ef3f6c17412b7f294a42144" master_src="http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-dc28143b3322dbebbb2fab8f766d4dc1" master_w="488" master_h="328"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red is powerful. Blue is crap. So when you’re describing your traction, use absolute numbers and growth numbers to communicate momentum. Consider:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We have 10K users.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK. That’s not bad, but there’s little context.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We have 10K users, growing at 25% per month.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s more exciting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sense is that for most metrics, less than 10-15% growth per month is uninteresting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;6) Tell a Story of a Customer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This technique works best for B2B or enterprise-related companies who are early in their progress. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We first started a pilot with Superchain, in one of their branches and with 15 employees. We’ve now expanded to 5 branches and 200 employees, and added two additional services. Superchain has over 1000 branches across 5 states.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does two things: shows the value you’re providing to a customer, and hints at the opportunity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;7) Benchmark Against a Known Competitor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This technique is aggressive and should not be overused, but it can work. Two that I’ve seen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Our CTR is 3X that of Techcrunch.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Our stock turnover is nearly twice as fast as Amazon’s”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this technique sparingly and pick comps that are relevant to your business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;8) Annotate a Graph&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great way to tell a story concisely, and show how your inputs have resulted in improvements in growth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class="qtext_image zoomable_in zoomable_in_feed" src="http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-049cd998dcb1812f6b196e4a50e62761" master_src="http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-eae8f9b0ce136854da0f3098e9944df7" master_w="488" master_h="328"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to work well for early startups, especially those in accelerators (they move fast).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;9) Using Testimonials as Traction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even shitty startups have glowing testimonials, so it doesn’t differentiate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;10) Using Press as Traction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even shitty startups can get good press. Repeat after me: ‘Getting on Techcrunch doesn’t mean that people want our product.’ ‘Getting on Techc...’ OK, you get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) This guide has nothing to do with how you build your product or company. That’s up to you. So please don’t confuse traction with the metrics you’d use to help guide your business. I know nothing about those!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Some traction metrics will be necessary, whether you want to use them or not. If a metric is core to your business, don’t try to hide it - you’ll only appear evasive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) This post is an extension of &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.quora.com/How-do-you-define-traction-for-a-start-up/answer/Brendan-Baker"&gt;Brendan Baker&amp;#039;s answer to How do you define &amp;#039;traction&amp;#039; for a start-up?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) There is no 4.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.quora.com/Brendan-Baker/Posts/Startups-How-to-Communicate-Traction-to-Investors#1302550257326524</guid><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2011 19:30:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What RSS feed readers learn what I like?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/What-RSS-feed-readers-learn-what-I-like/answer/Samuel-Clay</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;Samuel Clay added an answer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_276"&gt;&lt;div style="font-weight: bold; color: #000000"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu hidden hover_menu_wide" style="display: none" id="__w2_WpghPo3_menu"&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_nub"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hover_menu_contents" id="__w2_WpghPo3_menu_contents"&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a class="user" href="/Samuel-Clay" routing="q://user/(12196)" action_mousedown="UserLinkClickthrough" id="__w2_WpghPo3_link"&gt;Samuel Clay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I built a feed reader that will hide and highlight stories for you. You will have to train it, but this way there are no false negatives (hiding stories you don&amp;#039;t want hidden) and no false positives (highlight stories you don&amp;#039;t care about reading).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#039;s called NewsBlur and it&amp;#039;s available for free at: &lt;span class="qlink_container"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newsblur.com" rel="nofollow" class="external_link" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.newsblur.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Training is quick. You just thumbs up or thumbs down tags and classifiers that NewsBlur shows you. There is also an implicit component, but it only deals with which phrases to show you during training.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NewsBlur also shows you the original site, which is a unique feature not found in most other readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I built it to satisfy my needs in a feed reader, and it turns out many users share my preferences.

I&amp;#039;m an engineer, and when I want to work on a project outside of work, most cities would kick me out of coffee shops around 10 or 11pm, especially on weekdays. But here, I actually have the choice of going to a few different coffee shops and hacker groups that stay open until 1am on weekdays and 2am on weekends. That means I can get espresso and work in a social setting every single night of the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&amp;#039;s also NYC Nightowls, which is a social hackling group every Tuesday from 9pm - 4am. I know San Francisco has some of these options, but the availability in NYC is just astronomical. Not to mention Ace Hotel&amp;#039;s mix of wifi and coffee and 24 hour access. And it&amp;#039;s not all Manhattan centered either. Brooklyn has cheaper rent, safer neighborhoods, and still you can go to the Park Slope Tea Lounge and work with wifi until late into the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, much like San Francisco, there are many hacker groups in which to make friends and network. Not saying this is what New York has that San Francisco doesn&amp;#039;t, but more importantly, if you move to New York, you certainly won&amp;#039;t be missing out on the networking that helps you meet co-founders and future co-workers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-living-in-New-York-City-rather-than-in-San-Francisco"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-living-in-New-York-City-rather-than-in-San-Francisco/answer/Samuel-Clay#1280587111158914</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jul 2010 14:38:31 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What are ways to make a brilliant but somewhat lazy person work hard?</title><link>http://www.quora.com/What-are-ways-to-make-a-brilliant-but-somewhat-lazy-person-work-hard</link><description>&lt;div style="color: #666666"&gt;Samuel Clay followed a question.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="ld_bcivwu_280"&gt;&lt;span id="ld_bcivwu_281"&gt;10 Answers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold" href="http://www.quora.com/What-are-ways-to-make-a-brilliant-but-somewhat-lazy-person-work-hard"&gt;See question on Quora&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.quora.com/What-are-ways-to-make-a-brilliant-but-somewhat-lazy-person-work-hard#1276970198725177</guid><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2010 17:56:38 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
