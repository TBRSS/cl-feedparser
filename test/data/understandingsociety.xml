&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;source: G. Alter, "Completing Life Histories with Imputed Exit Dates" (&lt;a href="http://www.cairn.info/revue-population-english-2009-2-page-293.htm"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
I talked recently with George Alter, a leading historical demographer at the University of Michigan and author of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JHI0D6/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B002JHI0D6&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Family and the Female Life Course: The Women of Verviers, Belgium, 1849-1880&lt;/a&gt;. (Here is George's presidential address to the Social Science History Association in 2010; &lt;a href="http://www.ssha.org/pdfs/SSHA_Prez_Address_11.20.10.pdf"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.) Alter has been a long-standing partner in the Eurasian Population and Family History Project, a genuinely innovative "large science" effort to bring together demographic studies of locations from Sweden to Japan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
George and I talked about something that is of interest to philosophers of the social sciences, but is rarely discussed -- the comings and goings of methodological innovations in some areas of the social sciences. There are a handful of "big picture" questions that define the philosophy of social science, and these don't change very rapidly over time and discipline. For example: What is a good explanation? What is the logic of causal inference? How do facts about individuals relate to facts about structures? These are questions that are broadly applicable across many social-science disciplines, and often the answers are fairly similar in different disciplines as well. But it turns out that specific disciplines are sometimes confronted with problems of data analysis and inference that require new methods and new analytical tools, and there may be moments in which significant methodological change occurs in a relatively short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
George's field is historical demography -- the effort to reconstruct the population history of regions and countries through the registers and censuses that still exist for our study. This means examination of marriage behavior, fertility, mortality, emigration, and other key demographic trends. But it also means searching out the causes that can be traced of changes in these variables. So the field of historical demography is descriptive, but it is also analytical and causal; historical demographers are interested in identifying large social factors that influenced population behavior in centuries past.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The problem that Alter and some of his colleagues confronted in their research was a technical and logical one: how to extract the most useful information from &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;population registers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. And it turns out that answering this question requires developing radically new tools of analysis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Most readers will find the methods used in some parts of this study unfamiliar. Some of these methods, like hazard models, have only recently become common in the social sciences, and there have been few previous applications in family history. The development of a new methodology, which is presented below in Chapter 2, was dictated by the characteristics of the Belgian population registers, from which data on nineteenth-century Verviers have been drawn. (13)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A population register differs from a census in a crucial respect: it provides an exhaustive chronological list of the births, deaths, entries, exits, and marital changes of the population present in the region over a specific period of time. This turns out to be a very tricky problem, and one that was not easily handled by traditional techniques of demographic analysis. Traditionally demographers made use of "snapshots" of a population at a time: the size of the population, the percent employed in a given industry, the percent married, etc. But demographic processes are temporal processes; so looking at snapshots frozen in time tends to lose an important dimension of the phenomena. And the method that will work well for population registers needs to be custom-designed to do a good job of representing temporality.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alter describes the alternative methodology he and other demographers have developed to handle this particular set of problems in chapter two of &lt;i&gt;Family and the Female Life Course&lt;/i&gt;. It is a complicated story, but fundamentally it comes down to a shift of perspective on demographic process -- a shift from persons and events to intervals of time. This means moving away from counting individuals to counting "person years". Alter characterizes this shift with the following tables:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tFqWwIA4pFs/Ud2rK9sWk8I/AAAAAAAAIM4/GogMNY7HjPA/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-07-10+at+2.39.31+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="183" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tFqWwIA4pFs/Ud2rK9sWk8I/AAAAAAAAIM4/GogMNY7HjPA/s400/Screen+Shot+2013-07-10+at+2.39.31+PM.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Z0LSKmOb3yY/Ud2rK8GBjCI/AAAAAAAAIM0/mv_b54mhy6M/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-07-10+at+2.39.37+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="257" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Z0LSKmOb3yY/Ud2rK8GBjCI/AAAAAAAAIM0/mv_b54mhy6M/s400/Screen+Shot+2013-07-10+at+2.39.37+PM.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And here is another take on the same data, this time arranged by age of the person rather than absolute date:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gpXPws5JOa8/UeBbM76dT3I/AAAAAAAAINc/MsQwqB0h4jg/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-07-12+at+3.37.44+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="238" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gpXPws5JOa8/UeBbM76dT3I/AAAAAAAAINc/MsQwqB0h4jg/s400/Screen+Shot+2013-07-12+at+3.37.44+PM.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each of these ways of looking at the data highlights different aspects of the demographic history of this small group.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The information contained in the population register can be transformed into a data set representing person-years and status during that interval. And it is then possible to use these data elements to compute age-specific rates of various demographically important states. Alter emphasizes that these methods permit a much more fine-grained use of the information presented by a population register.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
There is much more information in the population registers than in the censuses and vital registers considered separately. The additional information comes from the linkage of information from the census to the demographic events and the linkage of events occurring in the life of each individual in the population register. (32)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Alter then undertakes to adapt statistical methods to the problem of assessing the causal importance of various sets of factors for the occurrence of other factors; for example, the effect of "living with parents between 25 and 30" on "lifetime fertility". The tool that Alter turns to is the statistics of hazard models. Here is a brief description of hazards models from Wikipedia:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Proportional hazards models are a class of survival models in statistics. Survival models relate the time that passes before some event occurs to one or morecovariates that may be associated with that quantity of time. In a proportional hazards model, the unique effect of a unit increase in a covariate is multiplicative with respect to the hazard rate. For example, taking a drug may halve one's hazard rate for a stroke occurring, or, changing the material from which a manufactured component is constructed may double its hazard rate for failure. Other types of survival models such as accelerated failure time models do not exhibit proportional hazards. These models could describe a situation such as a drug that reduces a subject's immediate risk of having a stroke, but where there is no reduction in the hazard rate after one year for subjects who do not have a stroke in the first year of analysis. (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_models"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There is an unexpected difficulty that this method must confront -- the problem of what demographers call&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;censoring&lt;/i&gt;. Essentially this comes down to the simple fact that a given population register leaves parts of an individual's life undocumented before and after the period covered by the register. So a woman who has not yet given birth at the age of 31 in 1835 (the end of the population register period) will be classified as childless; whereas she may well have a child in the next five years. But to add this woman into a raw count of women with and without children has the effect of under-estimating fertility. Alter shows how "life tables" can be used to address this problem. Essentially it is possible to use the data included in the population register itself to compute age-specific estimates of relevant variables (first marriage, first child, etc.) and then compute the average age of marriage from the life table. Here is an illustration:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
This post doesn't suffice to explain the methodology that Alter develops. Interested readers will need to work through Alter's analysis with the same rigor they would apply to learning a new piece of physics. But this brief description does serve to highlight a key fact about research in the social sciences: social science methodology is not finished. Different fields of research encounter new problems with new sources of data; but they also sometimes raise issues about better ways of handling data that has long been available. This means that there will often be times of lively activity and change in the methods of a social science. It also means that it is very interesting to follow the details of the development of a discipline during these periods of change.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(It is interesting to re-read William Sewell's essay, "Three Temporalities: Towards an Eventful Sociology" (in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226749185/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0226749185&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Logics of History: Social Theory and Social Transformation&lt;/a&gt;) in light of Alter's remarks about the temporality associated with demographic change.)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QeA9oJuYUOI/Udm7mHLXwzI/AAAAAAAAIMk/BS_fFIMHf5A/s1600/IMG_0313.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QeA9oJuYUOI/Udm7mHLXwzI/AAAAAAAAIMk/BS_fFIMHf5A/s400/IMG_0313.PNG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One element of the NSA revelations of the past month is the apparent fact that the NSA's PRISM program enables the agency to collect wholesale the transactions that occur on the Internet, including email header information. This follows the revelation that all metadata for phone calls made on the Verizon network (and presumably others) have been collected for a period of time -- perhaps as long as seven years. A &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/jul/07/nsa-gchq-metadata-reassurances"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; by John Naughton in the &lt;i&gt;Guardian&lt;/i&gt; (7 July 2013) highlights the intrusiveness that wholesale exposure of communications metadata creates for each individual's privacy -- without ever looking into the contents of the communications.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An MIT research group has created a tool called Immersion to allow anyone to graph his or her own email communications network (&lt;a href="https://immersion.media.mit.edu/"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). This is a very powerful tool, and it is accessible to all of us. So it is an experiment well worth undertaking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are the results for my own case. In the past three years I've transacted something like 60,000 email exchanges. The Immersion tool is able to analyze the metadata of this set of exchanges in a few minutes, and the resulting graphs are stunning. The vast and apparently disorderly library of messages turns out to have a very simple and revealing order. (I've removed the individual names from the graph, but these names are provided by the Immersion tool. An "analyst" would be able to focus in on any point of interest by name.) Here is the graph for the past three years of my communications:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QRwIlkrjFuE/Udmt_idHieI/AAAAAAAAIMU/upuk0zYb12Y/s1600/IMG_0317.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="369" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QRwIlkrjFuE/Udmt_idHieI/AAAAAAAAIMU/upuk0zYb12Y/s400/IMG_0317.PNG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is important to understand the inputs to this analysis. Only the data from my own email library has been used. Lots of connections are represented in the graph between other people. But these connections all come from my own email cache -- as cc's on messages to or from me. Second, I am not represented on the graph. Rather, each circle is one of the 250 or so people with whom I have had email contact in the past three years. Each circle's diameter represents the volume of flow between that person and me; and the breadth of the links between individuals represents the volume of flow between them as registered in my email cache. (The program apparently has a smart way of excluding messages from organizations like newsletters.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is evident that the graph simplifies my social network substantially (as captured by my email traffic). &amp;nbsp;In fact, it is possible to dissect the graph into several key core groups: the local administrators at the campus where I work, the administrators at the system level of the university,&amp;nbsp;a group of family members,&amp;nbsp;a small group of researchers with whom I communicate and who communicate with each other, a journal editorial group, and a non-profit organization I'm involved in. (There are also students on the graph, but they are single dots, since my email does not provide evidence of email connections among them. Likewise, there are other single-point researchers with whom I communicate (the blue dots lower right), but my cache doesn't indicate communications among them.) So here is the same graph with labels for the distinct groups:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DipLZ7TxtRI/UdmmD8Kxc_I/AAAAAAAAIMA/2-deApBpWIs/s1600/IMG_0320.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DipLZ7TxtRI/UdmmD8Kxc_I/AAAAAAAAIMA/2-deApBpWIs/s400/IMG_0320.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
It is interesting to observe that there are lots of&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;inter&lt;/i&gt;-group communications between members of the two administrative groups, but the two groups are clearly distinguished nonetheless on the graph. The &lt;i&gt;intra&lt;/i&gt;-group communication for each is dense enough to pull the two systems apart. This algorithmic network analysis, based on a very limited set of data, accurately uncovers the organizational structure and hierarchy of the university and the campus administrative groups. Also of interest is the fact that the graph does a decent job of analyzing&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;other people's&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;relationships -- without any data from them!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
In other words -- 60,000 messages boil down to a pretty simple and accurate picture of one person's activities over the past three years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Another facility that the Immersion tool provides is the ability to graph the recorded connections from any single person to everyone with whom he/she has communicated (out of my list of persons). The large purple circle in the first graph is the chief academic officer on my campus, who reports to me. This is the person with whom I communicate most frequently within the university. (By looking at the month-to-month frequency of communication, also provided by Immersion, it is also possible to single out the months where crises arose.) It is possible to blow up the circle of this individual's network as well, and see which individuals are most frequent connections (again, as recorded by cc's and forwards of messages from other people included in my own in-box). Here is the graph of the CAO's network:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--LneIst2Q28/UdmmDyONy_I/AAAAAAAAIL8/LJ9Arbtc300/s1600/IMG_0322.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="367" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--LneIst2Q28/UdmmDyONy_I/AAAAAAAAIL8/LJ9Arbtc300/s400/IMG_0322.PNG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now think how much more informative these graphs would be if an agency also had access to the email caches of the two hundred or so people represented here. Communications between X and Y that are minor or non-existent on my graph, may turn out to have broad links when this larger set of data is incorporated. And this is exactly the capability that most observers are now attributing to the PRISM and telephone capture programs of the NSA.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What this implies to me is that the people who are most worried about the NSA's wholesale data collection programs are probably right. The data that is being collected -- phone and email metadata, perhaps auto license readers, credit card transactions, and electronic toll and transportation cards as well -- this fund of data suffices to map out our personal lives in much, much greater detail than we would ever have imagined possible in a democratic society. We no longer have the luxury of "privacy through anonymity" or "haystack privacy". Once there is full information recorded over time of our electronic transactions (including, remember, locational data from our phones), our lives can be played back in detail at any point. And the Immersion tool shows that the software exists to make sense of such vast databases, enabling agencies to produce customized and individually tailored "dossiers" for all of us. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The revelations about the FISA court in today's &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; certainly support skepticism about the notion that these capabilities are carefully and properly controlled by the FISA process (&lt;a href="http://t.co/1WiCaGac0G"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). Here is a particularly worrisome finding in the NYT article:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
The officials said one central concept connects a number of the court’s opinions. The judges have concluded that the mere collection of enormous volumes of “metadata” — facts like the time of phone calls and the numbers dialed, but not the content of conversations — does not violate the Fourth Amendment, as long as the government establishes a valid reason under national security regulations before taking the next step of actually examining the contents of an American’s communications.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This legal theory specifically permits the kind of wholesale collection of metadata that can be used in the ways described here. And that is surely a profound threat to our privacy.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
It sometimes seems as though there isn't much new to say about Marx and his theories. But, like any rich and prolific thinker, that's not actually true. Two articles featured in the Routledge Great Economists series (&lt;a href="http://tandf.msgfocus.com/c/1hPXMlXtH7oz88ISgqxkuEMkm"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) are genuinely interesting. Both are deeply scholarly treatments of interesting aspects of the development of Marx's thinking, and each sheds new light on the influences and thought processes through which some of Marx's key ideas took shape. I will consider one of those articles here and leave the second, a consideration of Marx's relationship to the physiocrats, for a future post.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Regina Roth's "Marx on technical change in the critical edition" (&lt;a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09672567.2010.522239"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) is a tour-de-force in Marx scholarship. There are two aspects of this work that I found particularly worthwhile. The first is a detailed "map" of the work that has been done since the early twentieth century to curate and collate Marx's documents and notes. This was an especially important effort because Marx himself rarely brought his work to publishable form; he wrote thousands of pages of notes and documents in preparation for many related lines of thought, and not all of those problem areas have been developed in the published corpus of Marx's writings. Roth demonstrates a truly impressive grasp of the thousands of pages of materials included in the Marx-Engels Gesamtaushgabe (MEGA) and Marx-Engels Collected Works (MECW) collections, and she does an outstanding job of tracing several important lines of thought through published and unpublished materials. She notes that the MEGA collection is remarkably rich:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
A second point I want to stress is that the MEGA offers more material than other editions, not only regarding the manuscripts mentioned above but also with other types of written material. If we look at the material gathered in the MEGA we find examples of several different levels of communication. We may think of manuscripts on a first level as witnessing the communication between the author with himself and with his potential readers. On a second level, his letters give us notice of what he talked about to the people around him. And, on a third level, there is the vast part of his legacy that documents Marx's discourse with authors of his time: his excerpts, the books he read and his collections of newspaper cuttings. (1231)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Here is a table in which Roth correlates several important economic manuscripts in the two collections.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pgyWKnnH_mY/UdcSfiesrEI/AAAAAAAAILM/IRaYo0_xWS4/s1600/photo+(22).JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pgyWKnnH_mY/UdcSfiesrEI/AAAAAAAAILM/IRaYo0_xWS4/s400/photo+(22).JPG" width="400"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Careful study of these thousands of pages of manuscripts and notes is crucial, Roth implies, if we are to have a nuanced view of the evolution and logic of Marx's thought.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
They show, first of all, that Marx was never content with what he had written: he started five drafts of his first chapter, and added four fragments to the same subject, each of them with numerous changes within each text. (1228)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And study of these many versions, notes, and emendations shows something else as well: a very serious effort on Marx's part to get his thinking right. He was not searching out the most persuasive or the simplest versions of some of his critical thoughts about capitalism; instead, he was trying to piece together the economic logic of this social-economic system in a way that made sense given the analytical tools at his disposal. Marx was not the dogmatic figure that he is sometimes portrayed to be.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There are many surprises in Roth's study. The falling rate of profit? That's Engels' editorial summation rather than Marx's finished conclusion! By comparing Marx's original manuscripts with the posthumous published version of volume 3 of &lt;i&gt;Capital&lt;/i&gt;, she finds that "Engels inserted the following sentence in the printed version [of &lt;i&gt;Capital&lt;/i&gt; vol. 3]: 'But in reality [...] the rate of profit will fall in the long run' " (1233). In several important aspects she finds that Engels the editor was more definitive about the long-term tendencies of capitalism than Marx the author was willing to be. For example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Therefore, Engels continued, this capitalist mode of production 'is becoming senile and has further and further outlived its epoch.' Marx did not give such a clear opinion with a view to the future of capitalism, at least not in &lt;i&gt;Capital&lt;/i&gt;. (1233)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
She notes also that Engels was anxious about Marx's unwillingness to bring his rewriting and reconsideration of key theses to a close:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Shortly before the publication of Volume I of &lt;i&gt;Capital&lt;/i&gt;, Engels worried: 'I had really begun to suspect from one or two phrases in your last letter that you had again reached an unexpected turning-point which might prolong everything indefinitely.' (1247)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The other important aspect of this article -- the substantive goal of the piece -- is Roth's effort to reconstruct the development of Marx's thinking about technology and technology change, the ways that capitalism interacts with technology, and the effects that Marx expected to emerge out of this complicated set of processes. But this requires careful study of the full corpus, not simply the contents of the published works.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
To understand Marx's views on technical change, his whole legacy, which is also comprised of numerous drafts, excerpts, letters, and so forth, must be considered. (1224)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In fact, the unpublished corpus has much more substantial commentary on technology and technical change than do the published works. "In &lt;i&gt;Capital&lt;/i&gt; terms such as technical progress, technical change or simply technology turn up rarely" (1241).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Roth finds that Marx had a sustained interest in "the machinery question" -- essentially, the history of mechanical invention and the role that machines play in the economic system of capitalism. He studied and annotated the writings of Peter Gaskell, Andrew Ure, and&amp;nbsp;Charles&amp;nbsp;Babbage, as well as many other writers on the technical details of industrial and mining practices; Roth mentions Robert Willis and James Nasmyth in particular.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The economic importance of technical change for Marx's system is the fact that it presents the capitalist with the possibility of increasing "relative surplus value" by raising the productivity of labor (1241). But because technical innovation is generally capital-intensive (increasing the proportion of constant capital to variable capital, or labor), technical innovation tends to bring about a falling rate of profit (offset, as Roth demonstrates, by specific counteracting forces). So the capitalist is always under pressure to prop up the rate of profit, and more intensive exploitation of labor is one of the means available.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
In the discussion in the General Council [of the IWMA], Marx argued that machines had effects that turned out to be the opposite of what was expected: they prolonged the working day instead of shortening it; the proportion of women and children working in mechanized industries increased; labourers suffered from a growing intensity of labour and became more dependent on capitalists because they did not own the means of production any more .... (1246)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
So technology change and capitalism are deeply intertwined; and there is nothing emancipatory about technology change in itself.&lt;br&gt;

It may be useful to provide a brief account of some of the key ideas that are often invoked in causal explanations in the social sciences. (Here is an earlier post that summarized some current issues in causation research; &lt;a href="http://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2011/09/current-issues-in-causation-research.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;. And here are several earlier articles on causal explanation;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/37734891/causal%20explanation%20in%20the%20social%20sciences.pdf"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/37734891/explaining%20large-scale%20historical%20change.pdf"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/37734891/causal%20mechanisms%20mckay%20illari%20.pdf"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The general idea of a social cause (X causes Y) goes along these lines: X is a structure or feature of social life that varies across social settings and whose presence increases the likelihood of occurrence of Y. The presence of X (perhaps in the presence of Y and Z as well) contributes to processes leading to Y.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This simple formulation contains several hidden assumptions -- most importantly, that outcomes &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; causes, that causes retain their characteristics over time and across instances, and that there are processes or dynamics within the domain of things and processes that convey with some form of necessity one set of circumstances and events onto another.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For example, consider this hypothetical narrative describing a riot in a European city with a large community of impoverished immigrant people:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(C1) simmering resentment by immigrant youth of joblessness and low social esteem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(C2) heat wave creating discomfort and misery in crowded neighborhoods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(C3) chronic disrespectful and rough police treatment of immigrant youth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(I) forceful arrest of mis-identified young person in a city park, leading to serious injury of the youth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(O) several days of rioting occur&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
The associated causal hypothesis goes along these lines: In the context of simmering resentment by immigrant youth and a pattern of mistreatment by police, feelings in the community were unusually elevated by the heat wave. When the arrest occurred a small protest began in the park, which spread to other blocks in the city and eventuated in the burning of cars, smashing of shop windows, and multiple further arrests.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Conditions Ci are standing conditions that played a causal role in the occurrence of the riot. The arrest incident was the instigating event, the match that ignited the social "gasoline". If any of C1, C2, C3 had been changed six months earlier, it is unlikely that&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;would have occurred. Each was necessary for&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;leading to O in the circumstances of the day. &amp;nbsp;If C1, C2, C3 are present, it is likely that some instigating event will occur in the normal hustle-bustle of urban life.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;was the instigating condition. For researchers seeking general explanations of urban unrest, C1 and C3 appear to be strong candidates for common causes across many examples of urban riots. Two mechanisms are invoked here: a mechanism having to do with the individual's propensity to engage in protest ("resentment and mistreatment elevates propensity to protest") and a mechanism having to do with the spread of protest ("a small disturbance between a few teenagers and the police escalates through direct contact with other disaffected individuals through the neighborhood").&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are brief discussions of many of the concepts that are commonly invoked in discussions of social causation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Causal narrative&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An organized and temporally directed account of the occurrence of an event or change, identifying the conditions, circumstances, and events that were causally relevant to its occurrence. A narrative needs to provide &lt;i&gt;empirical evidence&lt;/i&gt; for its empirical claims and &lt;i&gt;theoretical justification&lt;/i&gt; for the causal mechanisms and processes it postulates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Standing condition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A condition or circumstance that persists through an extended period of time and that serves as part of the necessary causal background of a given causal process or mechanism. Persistent racial isolation is a standing condition in many explanations of the effects of inner city poverty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instigating event&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An instigating event is an occurrence, including change of state of some background property, that triggers a change in some other property or process. The early-morning arrest by patrons of a blind pig (unlicensed tavern) in Detroit was the instigating event of the 1967 Detroit riot/uprising.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Necessary condition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A condition that must be present in order for a given causal interaction to occur. "If X had not been present, the outcome O would not have occurred."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Sufficient condition (conjunction of conditions)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A condition (or conjunction of conditions) whose presence suffices to bring about the outcome. "If X&amp;amp;Y&amp;amp;Z were present, then O would have occurred."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Counterfactual statements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is worth underlining the point that necessary and sufficient conditions invoke counterfactual statements: If X had not occurred, Y would not have occurred. The logic of counterfactuals (modal logic) has a controversial and unresolved history. But given that causal language always implies some kind of necessity, we cannot dispense with counterfactuals and still have an adequate causal vocabulary.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;INUS condition (J. L. Mackie)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
J.L. Mackie's work on causation in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0198246420/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0198246420&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;The Cement of the Universe: A Study of Causation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;brought to closure a long line of thought about the logic of causal relations, culminating in his concept of INUS conditions. Consider this complex causal statement about the circumstances causing P:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
'All (ABC or DGH or JKL) are followed by P' and 'All P are preceded by&amp;nbsp;(ABC or DGH or JKL)' (Mackie, 62)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Mackie then defines an INUS condition:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Then in the case described above the complex formula '(ABC or DGH or JKL)' represents a condition which is both necessary and sufficient for P: each conjunction, such as 'ABC', represents a condition which is sufficient but not necessary for P. Besides, ABC is a &lt;em&gt;minimal&lt;/em&gt; sufficient condition: &amp;nbsp;none of its conjuncts is redundant: no part of it, such as AB, is itself sufficient for P. But each single factor, such as A, is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for P. Yet it is clearly related to P in an important way: it is an &lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;em&gt;nsufficient&lt;/em&gt; but &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;n&lt;/u&gt;on-redundant&lt;/em&gt; part of an &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;nnecessary&lt;/em&gt; but &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;ufficient&lt;/em&gt; condition: it will be convenient to call this … an inus condition. (62)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
To simplify:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A is an INUS condition for P if for some X and Y, (AX v Y) is a necessary and&amp;nbsp;sufficient condition for P, but A is not sufficient for P and X is not sufficient for P.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Causal mechanism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An interlocked series of events and processes that, once initiated by some set of conditions, [usually] brings about a given outcome O. The idea that there are real mechanisms embodied in the "stuff" of a given domain of phenomena provides a way of presenting causal relations that serves as a powerful alternative to the "regularity" view associated with Hume. "Poor performance on standardized tests by specific groups is caused by the mechanism of stereotype threat" (Claude Steele, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393339726/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0393339726&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Whistling Vivaldi: How Stereotypes Affect Us and What We Can Do (Issues of Our Time)&lt;/a&gt;). This mechanism is a hypothesized process within the cognitive-emotional system of the subjects of the test. (James Mahoney's survey article on the mechanisms literature is a good introduction to the debate; &lt;a href="http://www.jamesmahoney.org/articles/Beyond%20Correlational%20Analysis.pdf"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Causal powers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The idea that certain kinds of things (metals, gases, military bureaucracies) have internal characteristics that lead them to interact causally with the world in specific and knowable ways. This means that we can sometimes identify dispositional properties that attach to kinds of things. Metals conduct electricity; gases expand when heated; military bureaucracies centralize command functions. (Harre and Madden, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/063116040X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=063116040X&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Causal Powers: Theory of Natural Necessity&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Probabilistic causal relation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A relationship between A and O such that the occurrence of A increases/decreases the likelihood of the occurrence of O. This can be stated in terms of conditional probabilities: P(O|A) ≠&amp;nbsp;P(O) [the probability of O given A is not equal to the probability of O]. For a causal realist, the definition is extended by a hypothesis about an underlying causal mechanism. [Smoking is a probabilistic cause of lung cancer [working through physiological mechanisms X,Y,Z]. This is equivalent to Wesley Salmon's criterion of causal relevance (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691101701/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0691101701&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Scientific Explanation and the Causal Structure of the World&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Causal explanation of a singular event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When we are interested in the explanation of a single event, a causal narrative leading up to that event is generally what we are looking for. What led to the outbreak of World War I? Why did Khomeini come to power in Iran in 1979? There are generally two difficult problems facing a proposed causal-narrative explanation of a singular event. First, we need to somehow empirically validate the claims about causal mechanisms and processes that are invoked in the narrative. But since this is a singular event, we do not have the option of using experimental methods to empirically test the claim "X leads by mechanism M to Y" that the narrative proposes. This is one important reason why mechanism theorists have generally required that specified mechanisms have roughly similar causal properties in a range of circumstances. Circumstances embodying the core features of a public goods problem usually lead to elevated levels of free riding -- whether in public radio fundraising, strikes, classroom discussions, or rebellions. Second, there is the problem of alternative realizability and multiple causal pathways leading to the same outcome. If the conditions leading to World War I were sufficiently ominous, then whether the assassination of the Archduke or some other event brought it about is of less explanatory importance. Given that potential instigating events occur with a certain probability, some event would have occurred within those few months that led to war. So it is better to identify the standing conditions that made war likely as the causes, rather than the assassination of the Archduke.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Generalizations about the causes of a kind of social entity or event&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We are often interested in answering causal questions about classes of events: Why do peasant rebellions occur? Why does corruption rise to such high levels in many cities? Why do democracies not wage war against each other? Here we are looking for common conjunctions of causal factors that can be shown to be causally relevant in many such events. It is possible that we will discover that peasant rebellions do not have a single set of causal antecedents; rather there are multiple profiles of peasant rebellions, each with a set of causal conditions significantly different from the other profiles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods of causal inquiry&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How can social researchers identify causal relations among social events and structures? There are several groups of methods that social scientists and historians have employed: statistical-causal models, small-N models based on Mill's methods of similarity and difference (&lt;a href="http://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2009/08/john-stuart-mill-as-social-science.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2008/02/paired-comparisons.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), and case studies and process-tracing methods through which researchers seek to identify and confirm causal relations in individual cases. In each case the method derives from fundamental ideas about the nature of causation: the idea that causal relations between several factors give rise to statistical regularities when we have a large number of cases; the idea that we can use the features of necessary and sufficient conditions to select cases in order to include or exclude certain factors as causally related to the outcome; and the idea that causal mechanisms and processes can often be observed fairly directly in the historical record (Alexander George and Andrew Bennett, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262572222/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0262572222&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Case Studies and Theory Development in the Social Sciences&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The idea of social causation is a difficult one, as we dig more deeply into it. What does it mean to say that "poor education causes increased risk of delinquency" or "population growth causes technology change" or "the existence of paramilitary organizations contributed to the rise of German fascism"? What sorts of things can function as "social causes" -- events, structures, actions, forces, other? What social interactions extend over time in the social world to establish the links between cause and effect? What kinds of evidence are available to support the claim that "social factor X causes a change in social factor Y"?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Helen Beebee, Christopher Hitchcock, and Peter Menzies'&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199642583/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0199642583&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Causation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a valuable resource on topics involving the philosophy of causation, and several of the contributions are immediately relevant to current debates within the philosophy of social science.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Harold Kincaid considers a number of the hard questions about social causation in his contribution to the &lt;i&gt;Handbook&lt;/i&gt;, "Causation in the Social Sciences". Perhaps most relevant to my ongoing concerns is his defense of non-reductionist claims about social causation. It is often maintained (by methodological individualists) that causal relations exist only among individuals, not among higher-level social entities or structures. (Elster and Hedstrom make claims along these lines in multiple places.) Kincaid rejects this view and affirms the legitimacy of macro- or meso-level causal assertions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
When a particular corporation acts in a market, it has causal influence. The influence of that specific entity is realized by the actions of the individuals composing it just as the influence of the baseball on the breaking window is realized by the sum of particles composing it. The social level causal claims pick out real causal patterns as types that may not be captured by individual kinds because multiple realizability is real. (kl 16102)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These arguments are a valuable antidote to the tendency towards reductionism to the level of individual activity that has often guided philosophers when they have considered the nature of social causation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Phil Dowe's discussion of causal process theories is useful for the social sciences ("Causal Process Theories"). It is hard to think of the social world as an amalgam of discrete events; it is easier to think of a variety of processes unfolding, subject to a range of forces and obstacles. &amp;nbsp;Dowe gives much of the credit for current interest in causal process language to Wesley Salmon (along with resurrection of the idea of a "rope of causation" to replace that of a "chain of causation").&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For Salmon the causal structure of the world consists in the nexus of causal processes and interactions. A process is anything with constancy of structure over time. (kl 4924)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The language of causal processes seems to fit the nature of social causation better than that of events and systems of billiard balls. And we have the makings of a metaphysics of process available in the social sciences, in the form of a stream of actions and reactions of individuals aggregating to recognizable social patterns. So when we say that "population increase stimulates technology innovation", we can picture the swarming series of interactions, demands, and opportunities that flows from greater population density, to rewards for innovation, to a more rapid rate of innovation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another useful contribution in the &lt;i&gt;Handbook&lt;/i&gt; with special relevance to the social world is Stephen Mumford's contribution, "Causal Powers and Capacities."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
The powers ontology accepts necessary connections in nature, in which the causal interactions of a thing, in virtue of its properties, can be essential to it. Instead of contingently related cause and effect, we have power and its manifestation, which remain distinct existences but with a necessary connection between. (kl 5971)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The language of causal powers allows us to incorporate a number of typical causal assertions in the social sciences: "Organizations of type X produce lower rates of industrial accidents," "paramilitary organizations promote fascist mobilization," "tenure systems in research universities promote higher levels of faculty research productivity." In each case we are asserting that a certain kind of social organization possesses, in light of the specifics of its rules and functioning, a disposition to stimulate certain kinds of participant behavior and certain kinds of aggregate outcomes. This is to attribute a specific causal power to species of organizations and institutions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stuart Glennan's "Mechanisms" is also highly relevant to causation in the social realm. Here is how Glennan puts the mechanisms theory (quoting his own earlier formulations):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Glennan ... characterizes mechanisms in this way: 'A mechanism underlying a behavior is a complex system which produces that behavior by the interaction of a number of parts according to direct causal laws (Glennan &lt;a href="http://digitalcommons.butler.edu/facsch_papers/27/"&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;: 52). Glennan then suggests that two events are causally related when and only when they are connected by an intervening mechanism. (kl 7069)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This definition works pretty well with typical examples of social mechanisms, with one important exception -- the reference to "direct causal laws". When we say that Organization X works to minimize accidents, the sub-transactions that are involved in the workings of the overall process are not typically "direct causal laws," but rather the intelligible results of individual actors performing their actions within the rules, incentives, and sanctions of the organization. We can tell a mechanism story along these lines: "Organization X embodies a set of protocols of operation, a training regime, a supervisory regime, and and enforcement regime. The protocols have the result that, when followed consistently, accidents are rare. Employees are 'programmed' to perform their tasks according to this set of protocols. Supervisors are trained to observe and measure employee performance against the protocols. Enforcement provides sanctions and incentives for bad and good performance." The complex mechanism of the organization works to implement and maintain the smooth functioning of the guiding protocols. So the organization embodies just the kind of complex system that Glennan describes as a mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So the &lt;i&gt;Handbook&lt;/i&gt; is a good resource for all of us who are interested in working through a more satisfactory account of what it means to look at social phenomena as embodying causal relations in ways that support explanations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(The photo of ice forming on glass included above is a metaphorical reference to social causation. Intricate patterns have emerged from a causal process; but it is a process that reflects a high degree of contingency and path-dependency across the expanse of the scene. And there is no overall order to the multiple patterns that emerge; each location is independent of other locations, and there is no answer to questions like this: "Why is Structure A located in the particular position and orientation that it is found to be?" Patterns&amp;nbsp;coalesce&amp;nbsp;and they do so as a result of locally operative causal processes, but there is no overall guiding hand or teleology to the process. The greatest disanalogy I can see here is the fact that the ice-formation process is much simpler than typical social-causal systems. Instead of a single causal mechanism at work in the ice case, there are dozens of overlapping and interactive causal mechanisms at work in most social processes.)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
How can we design practical, effective, and fair institutions for making the basic decisions that are needed within a democratic government? This is, of course, one of the oldest questions in democratic theory; but it is also a recent concern of Jon Elster's. Under this rubric we can investigate, for example, the ways a legislature sets its agenda and votes or the ways constitutional principles function to secure citizens' rights. Fundamentally we want to create institutions that reach good outcomes through a set of decision-making processes that minimize the workings of bias, self serving, and special interests.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Elster takes up these sorts of considerations in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1107649951/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1107649951&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Securities Against Misrule: Juries, Assemblies, Elections&lt;/a&gt;. Here Elster concentrates on themes expressed by Jeremy Bentham, a philosopher whom Elster regards as being badly underrated. One part of Elster's goal here is to recapture some of these overlooked insights. But he also wants to contribute to the substantive issue: what features of institutional design increase the likelihood of political outcomes that largely conform to the best interests of society (whatever those are)?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Elster’s treatment of Bentham is focused on a small number of theoretical issues in public decision theory. Bentham’s core goal was to work out some features of institutional design that would make corruption and misuse of power least likely in an electoral democracy. “In Bentham’s view, the object of institutional design is security against misrule, or the prevention of mischief—the removal of obstacles that will thwart the realization of the greatest good for the greatest number” (1).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Elster endeavors to explicate Bentham’s ideas on this topic; but he is also interested in forwarding the argument in his own terms. “My purpose is to consider procedural accounts of good institutional design” (5). And further: "I shall be concerned with removing -- or blocking the effect of -- known obstacles to good decision making" (17). So we can look at this book as being both a contribution to the history of thought and a substantive, rigorous contribution to contemporary debates about institutional design.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The obstacles that interfere with "good decision making" in the area of public choice are numerous: bad sheep in the process (domineering individuals or spoilers; 18); the effects of strategic behavior by participants; cyclical voting outcomes (Arrow paradox); dictatorship (institutional arrangements that permit one actor to determine the outcome); sensitivity of the collective outcome to the order of the agenda; procedural indeterminacy; power differentials; capture of the process by special interests; deadlock through requirements of super majorities; and information asymmetries among participants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;"&gt;
One family of mechanisms that Elster considers in some detail involve ignorance, secrecy, and publicity (chapter 2). Consider an example. Suppose a hospital aims to increase patient health and reduce costs by pre-selecting preferred medications for a small group of diagnoses. And suppose it assigns this task to a formal committee of physicians and other health professionals. The rules that define membership, deliberation, and decision-making of this committee need to be established. The desiderata for the functioning of the committee are clear. We want members to deliberate impersonally and neutrally, and to favor or disfavor candidate medications based on efficacy and cost. It will help to prevent bias if we block committee members from having knowledge of how the choice of X or Y will influence their own incomes. And publicity about the questions being referred to the committee and the resolutions those questions have received can also induce more neutral behavior by committee members to decide the issue on the basis of objective costs and benefits (rather than private self-interest). This is the purpose of "sunshine laws" about public deliberations and contracts.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;"&gt;
Elster looks in detail at alternative designs that have been implemented in the use of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;jury trials&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to assess guilt or innocence (chapter 2). How are jurors selected? What information is provided to the jury, and what information is withheld? Are the identities of jurors known to defendants? Choices that are made in each of these design areas are pertinent to a variety of sources of distortion of outcome: racial bias, self interest on the part of the juror, or intimidation of the jury by confederates of the defendant.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;"&gt;
The fundamental point that Elster takes from Bentham is that institutions should not be considered in terms of their ideal functioning, but in terms of how they will function when populated by ordinary people subject to a range of bad motivations (self-interest, prejudice, bias in favor of certain groups, ...). This is the point of "security against misrule" -- to find mechanisms that obviate the workings of venality, bias, and self-interest on the part of the participants. In a sense, this is a return to problems of imperfect rationality that interested Elster early in his career; but this time these problems are raised in the context of collective rationality.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
One place where Jon Elster's philosophical thinking intersects with empirical social science is in the field of institutional design. This involves an important question: What features of institutional design can be identified as having beneficent features of operation when exercised by normal groups of individuals?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This topic has cropped up several times in Elster's career. One important instance is the work he highlighted about alternatives to market society in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/052137815X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=052137815X&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Alternatives to Capitalism&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Jon Elster and Karl Ove Moene, eds., 1989). &amp;nbsp;Here is how Elster and Moene put the point in their introduction:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Capitalism -- actually existing capitalism -- appears in many respects to be an ugly, irrational, wasteful way of organising the production and distribution of goods and services.... Five of the essays in the present volume discuss whether there could be alternatives to presently existing capitalism other than central planning. Could, for instance, central planning be tempered by the market, or capitalism tempered by planning? (1-2)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
So the core questions that arise here are these: Are there workable alternatives concerning the coordination of work and the management of property that work better than&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;laissez-faire&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;capitalism and wage labor? And what does "better" mean in this context? A partial answer to the "better" question might go along these lines: we want workable institutions that better embody equality and self-control than an unregulated market. "Workable" means "reasonably efficient and productive", and self-control means something like "shop floor self-determination."&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is important to be specific about the normative aspects of institutional design. In order to assess the goodness or badness of an institution, we need to have specific virtues that we hope it will fulfill. Here is the list of virtues that Elster and Moene identify for basic economic institutions:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
We discuss some of the main normative criteria that are relevant to a comparison of different economic systems. These include static efficiency (including full employment), dynamic efficiency, self-realisation, participation, community, quality of preferences, stability, economic freedom, and income distribution. (3)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These desiderata need to be spelled out more fully. Static and dynamic efficiency as well as stability have to do with the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;economic performance&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; of a set of institutional arrangements when populated by normal human beings. Are resources allocated across productive activities in an efficient way? Is labor productivity high? Do the institutions encourage high-quality production? Self-realization, participation, &amp;nbsp;economic freedom, and community are all &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;normative goals&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; we may have for basic social institutions. Do the institutions provide ordinary human beings the opportunities they need to fulfill their human talents and aspirations? Do the institutions provide opportunities for all participants to take part in the decision-making processes of the institution? Do these institutions afford individuals a broad range of choice in terms of how they conduct their lives? &amp;nbsp;Do the specific arrangements of the institutions promote trust, solidarity, and mutual respect among the persons involved in them? Quality of preferences has to do with the effects these institutions have on the formation of the goals and desires of the individuals involved. Do the institutions help to cultivate an appetite for what J. S. Mill described as the higher pleasures -- a preference for Pushkin over push-pin? And income distribution is a feature that has &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;both normative and empirical characteristics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;; highly unequal distributions may undermine stability, and they may also undermine self-realization and participation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One alternative economic institution that is considered in detail in the volume is workers' cooperatives -- systems where the cooperative owns the capital of the enterprise and democratic rules of decision-making permit cooperative members to define work rules and income distributions. Karl Ove Moene explores this institutional variant in his contribution. Here is how Elster and Moene introduce the idea of a cooperative in the introduction:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
What is a cooperative? The answer to the question might seem obvious: A cooperative is a firm in which the workers own the means of production and have full control over all economic decisions. Yet the answer, as it stands, is ambiguous and incomplete. It fails to capture the variety and complexity of existing cooperatives. (22)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A more complete and differentiated taxonomy of cooperatives is needed, since variations in institutional design can have very large consequences for the behavior of the overall institution. Here are some of the ways that cooperatives vary in the historical record:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full ownership by workers or just workers' control over decisions? (22)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equal ownership rights or stratified ownership rights? (24)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shop-floor democracy for all workers, or professional management team selected by the workers? (24)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Static business environment or rapidly changing business environment? (27)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large firms or small firms? (27)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Production process that permits high/low level of monitoring by other workers (27)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Elster and Moene suggest that these variations of internal design and external business and technical environment make a large difference to the effectiveness of cooperative firms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Elster and Moene argue that the workers' cooperative alternative needs to be carefully evaluated with respect to the desiderata mentioned here. &amp;nbsp;They argue that this evaluation needs to be comparative, and it needs to proceed along two tracks -- observation of the actual experience of such institutions, and application of economic theory to the fundamentals of the institutional arrangement. The economic theory of cooperatives is weak, in their assessment, but there is a fair amount of empirical data about how they work. And the empirical data is favorable to cooperatives. "The empirical literature suggests, but far from unambiguously, that cooperation and participation increase productivity" (29). They cite studies documenting lower turnover of the labor force, lower rates of absenteeism, and no strikes (29).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also worth highlighting is Elster's own contribution to the volume, "Self-realisation in work and politics: the Marxist conception of the good life" (127 ff.). Here Elster takes issue with several foundational premises of the pro-capitalist argument as a normative position: "(a) The best life for the individual is one of consumption ... (b) Consumption is to be valued because it promotes happiness or welfare, which is the ultimate good" (127). Against these comsumerist ideals, Elster argues for the importance of self-realization -- the full and free development of one's talents and aspirations, to a reasonable extent. He contrasts self-realizing activities (mastering the piano) with activities of pure consumption (eating a tuna sandwich at your desk) and drudgery (sweeping the streets for forty years). This is plainly a normative position: a life involving self-realization is &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; than a life of consumption and drudgery. And it has a long pedigree, from J. S. Mill and J. J. Rousseau to Kant to Sen and Nussbaum. What Elster adds to the tradition is important, though: the idea that our ideal of personal fulfillment and a good human life is in fact a key element of the matrix by which we should evaluate alternative institutions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a very interesting volume, for several reasons. The individual essays are very good, by experts like G. A. Cohen, Alec Nove, and John Roemer as well as Elster and Moene. But even more interesting is the shock value of its topic in the neo-liberal environment in which we have found ourselves for the past twenty years or so. To have serious scholars making careful, rigorous efforts to explore and evaluate "alternatives to capitalism" is very surprising in today's environment; and yet the essays were written as recently as the late 1980s. Plainly there was practical and political interest in the topic of alternatives to capitalism in those years that has largely disappeared in today's discourse. This suggests that somehow serious progressive thought has been muffled for the past twenty years. It is time to resurrect it.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xyRO3rQv47Y/UcMCJ6r-Z9I/AAAAAAAAIHc/TjbQKLbXMfM/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-06-20+at+9.26.01+AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="225" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xyRO3rQv47Y/UcMCJ6r-Z9I/AAAAAAAAIHc/TjbQKLbXMfM/s320/Screen+Shot+2013-06-20+at+9.26.01+AM.png" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alford Young is professor of sociology at the University of Michigan and an expert on the life experience of inner-city African-American men. He is also chair of the department of sociology at Michigan. His 2006 book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/069112700X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=069112700X&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;The Minds of Marginalized Black Men: Making Sense of Mobility, Opportunity, and Future Life Chances&lt;/a&gt;, is based on several dozen interviews in Chicago of young men in one of the most segregated parts of the city.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Professor Young's research falls within "cultural sociology," and is an effort to gain more nuanced understandings of the mentalities and thinking of one segment of America's racialized society. Young is unambiguous in endorsing the value of qualitative methods in sociology, although he observes late in the interview that his conversations with young black men are always set in the context of a set of structures of race, economy, and opportunity that need to be investigated through other methods as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Young has some boundary-breaking ideas about how urban sociology can be pursued, and his research is an important contribution to contemporary sociology. Here is an earlier post on Young's work;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2012/07/thinking-poverty-in-inner-city.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This month Young agreed to participate&amp;nbsp;with me in a wide-ranging discussion about the content and aims of his research and the ways that it relates to his own early experiences as an African-American young man growing up in East Harlem. The discussion ranges over a number of topics of interest to anyone wanting to understand contemporary sociology better. He talks about the methods and content of his research (wide-ranging, intensive conversations with young inner-city men); some of the surprises this research leads to; the importance of this kind of research as an antidote to the stereotypes that white Americans and commentators often share about inner-city youth; and the question of how these qualitative interviews contribute to a level of generalization about contemporary inner-city experience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another important thread in the conversation has to do with Young's own childhood and adolescence in Harlem, and the ways in which his family's status in the world of African-Americans professionals in New York intersected with his residential experience in one of the most segregated and impoverished parts of the city. This duality of experience gave Young a cultural fluency that allow him to navigate both worlds as a social science researcher.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Young also talks about the importance that specific role models played for him in the formation of his own career goals and intellectual values: exposure to African-American civil rights lawyers as a high school student and exposure to a charismatic African-American professor in college. The professor served as a mentor to Young, permitting him to gain an appetite for a career as a researcher and teacher in the university.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Young's work focuses on the experience of young African-American men in segregated American cities. But the insights and approach are equally relevant to a very wide range of subjects, both domestically and internationally. How do Chinese migrant workers perceive the choices open to them and the working conditions they find in Chinese cities? What is the worldview of young immigrant men and women in Stockholm, and how does that fit into the outbreak of extended rioting there in the past month? How do homeless people in Boston or Chicago think about their situations and the choices available to them? Everywhere there are distinctive human communities and bodies of experience that are worth knowing more about, and almost always the preliminary stereotypes we have about those communities are wrong or seriously incomplete. So the kind of qualitative cultural sociology to which Al Young has contributed is an important addition to sociology that can be extended in many different ways.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here is a &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/n75vqdwMTDA"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to the interview.&lt;br /&gt;

Nancy Cartwright has spent much of her career probing the assumptions scientists make about causation. She has helped to demonstrate that the Humean assumptions about causation that philosophers (including Carl Hempel) carried into twentieth century philosophy of science don't come close to answering the question correctly, and she has provided many reasons to take seriously the ideas of causal powers and mechanisms rather than governing causal regularities. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0198247044/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0198247044&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;How the Laws of Physics Lie&lt;/a&gt; is an important contribution to the philosophy of science and to realist theory.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her current book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199841624/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0199841624&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Evidence-Based Policy: A Practical Guide to Doing It Better&lt;/a&gt; (with Jeremy Hardie) provides a different critical perspective on causal inference, this time in the context of social policy reasoning. The design and implementation of public policies rest upon a fundamental premise: that we can have evidence-based reasons for predicting what the effects of the policy tool will likely be. But what kind of evidence might that be? The dominant form of evidence favored in the policy science field is random controlled trials: specify the policy intervention P, choose a domain of cases to apply the intervention P to, randomly select cases to receive the intervention (versus the control group that does not), and measure the value of the outcome of interest. If there is a significant difference in the value of the outcome between test group and control group, then we have evidence that P had an effect.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In a nutshell, C&amp;amp;H take issue with the conviction that random controlled trials &amp;nbsp;(RCT) -- the gold standard of causal inference and experiment in clinical medicine -- provide a basis for expecting that a given policy intervention will have similar effects in the future. Their book can be read as a critique of an excessively statistical understanding of social causality, without realistic analysis of the underlying mechanisms and processes. As Cartwright and Hardie state repeatedly, RCT evidence shows only that the policy worked on the circumstances tested in the study. Instead, they argue that we need to offer evidence about two additional considerations: whether the "causal principle" associated with P will remain the same in new circumstances; and whether the associated conditions necessary for the operation of this principle will be present in the new circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here is a fundamental statement of what they mean by a causal principle:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
We suppose that causes do not produce their effects by accident, at least not if you are to be able to make reliable predictions about what will happen if you intervene. Rather, if a cause produces an effect, it does so because there is a reliable, systematic connection between the two, a connection that is described in a &lt;i&gt;causal principle&lt;/i&gt;. (22)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The statement, "El Nino causes wet winters in North America," is a causal principle. But causal principles are neither universal nor exceptionless:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
The fact that causal principles can differ from locale to locale means that you cannot read off that a policy will work here from even very solid evidence that it worked somewhere else. (23)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Here is a more extensive description of this idea:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Causal principles are not universal. They differ from place to place and from time to time. That means that it is not enough for you to know that the policy worked somewhere or even that it has worked at some time here. “It worked there”; it played a positive causal role there. So it was one of the factors from a causal principle that holds there. To predict that it will work here, you need to know that it is one of the factors from a causal principle that holds here. That is what ensures that it can play a positive causal role for you. (50)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Cartwright and Hardie look at causation along the lines of J. L. Mackie's analysis of INUS conditions in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0198246420/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0198246420&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;The Cement of the Universe&lt;/a&gt;: a factor is a cause if it is an "Insufficient but Necessary part of an Unnecessary but Sufficient condition for producing a contribution to the effect" (23). The evidence of favorable CRT studies for a given policy intervention doesn't show that this policy will work in the new circumstances of the new proposed application. In order to draw this inference we need to have confidence that the treatment will play the same causal role in the new setting, and that the necessary conditions will be present in that setting. In other words, we need a more detailed causal analysis of the past and the proposed future. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here is a sketch of the argument that C&amp;amp;H suggest we need to provide in order to project favorable RCT studies onto future applications:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;x works there (i.e., x genuinely appears in the causal principle that governs the production of y there post-implementation).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here and there share that causal principle post-implementation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The support factors necessary for x to contribute under that principle are present for at least some individuals here post-implementation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion. x works here (i.e., x genuinely appears in the causal principle that governs the production of y here post-implementation and the support factors necessary for it to contribute to y are present for at least some individuals here post-implementation). (41)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
One way of offering support for premise 2 is to engage in the method of &lt;i&gt;process tracing&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
This method confirms the existence of a causal connection between start and finish by confirming, one-by-one, a series of smaller causal steps in between. (38)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Cartwright doesn't put her case in these terms, but I would say that the heart of her intuition is that social outcomes are different from medical outcomes because of their inherent &lt;i&gt;causal heterogeneity&lt;/i&gt;. In the social world outcomes like teen pregnancy rates or high school dropout rates are the result of a bundle of conjunctural causal processes. So projecting the results of past random controlled trials into the future requires that we first confirm that the same causal influences and important background conditions are at work. And this is rarely the case. So the fundamental underlying prescription is a pragmatic causal realism about social processes: in order to design and implement policies, we need to have a well developed map of the real causal processes and mechanisms that are underway in the production of the effect we would like to change. In other words, we need to be causal realists if we are to be effective policy makers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(It is worth observing that this book is deliberately different in tone and specialization from Cartwright's other monographs in the philosophy of causation. The book is designed to be useful for real practitioners of public policy, and it offers clear advice about how to gain the understandings needed in order to validate the idea that a given policy will have desired effects in a novel setting.)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The fourth edition of Thomas Kuhn's&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226458121/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0226458121&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;appeared in 2012, fifty years after its original appearance in 1962. This edition contains a very good introduction by Ian Hacking, himself a distinguished philosopher and philosopher of science. So it is very interesting to reread Kuhn's classic book with the commentary and intellectual frame that Hacking provides. (Here is an earlier post on Kuhn; &lt;a href="http://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2009/10/kuhns-paradigm-shift.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hacking's reading is somewhat deflationary, compared to the relativist and anti-rationalist interpretations that are sometimes offered of Kuhn's theories. Hacking sees a great deal of continuity between the Vienna Circle traditions of philosophy of science and Kuhn's own intellectual commitments about scientific rationality. (Hacking pursues this analogy even down to noting a parallel between Carnap's title &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0415613795/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0415613795&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Logical Syntax of Language&lt;/a&gt; and a similar description of Kuhn's later work, &lt;i&gt;Logical Syntax of Scientific Language&lt;/i&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
According to Hacking, the scope of the concept of "paradigm" has been exaggerated by subsequent interpreters. Paradigms are not systems of thought or conceptual systems; they are not even discipline-specific sets of shared assumptions that don't get questioned in the ordinary pursuit of scientific knowledge. Instead, Hacking argues that Kuhn's intended meaning sticks fairly close to the classical meaning of the term, as an exemplar of something or other. He quotes Kuhn:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
"The paradigm as shared example is the central element of what I now take to be the most novel and least understood aspect of this book." &amp;nbsp;(from the Postscript, kl 213)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
So a good example of a paradigm in science is something like the Millikan oil drop experiment; it constituted a clear and admirable example of experimental design and implementation which helped to guide later experimentalists in the design of their own experiments.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hacking also notes that Kuhn later allows for a local use and a global use of the concept, but he suggests that Kuhn did not wholly endorse the global use. Here is how Hacking paraphrases the global use, in the context of the things that hold a scientific research community together:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
That's the global sense of the word, and it is constituted by various kinds of commitment and practices, among which he emphasizes symbolic generalizations, models, and exemplars. (Kl 318)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hacking gently suggests that Kuhn under-values "normal science," because he shares a bias towards theory with many other philosophers of science of the preceding generation. But Hacking argues that later philosophers and historians of science, such as Peter Galison, have given more weight to the innovations associated with experimentation and instrumentation (kl 199), and the process of normal science is precisely the context in which innovations in these aspects of science are most likely to occur.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hacking makes an interesting point about the scientific context in which Kuhn's ideas took shape. Physics, both classical and modern, set the standard for what was most exciting within the scientific enterprise in the 1950s and 1960s. But Hacking asks an interesting question: what if the examples of biology and the life sciences had been the backdrop against which Kuhn had formulated his theories? Molecular biology and the chemistry of DNA constituted a revolution in biology at roughly the time of the original publication of SSR. How valid are Kuhn's observations about scientific research and progress against that backdrop? Would the results have perhaps been quite different if he had concentrated on these examples?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Thus &lt;i&gt;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions &lt;/i&gt;may be -- I do not say is -- more relevant to a past epoch in the history of science than it is to the sciences as they are practiced today. (Kl 98)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hacking gives a very succinct summary of Kuhn's main theory of the course of science:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Here is the sequence. (1) normal science ...; (2) puzzle solving ...; (3) paradigm, a word which, when he used it, was uncommon, but which after Kuhn has become banal ... ; (4) anomaly; (5) crisis; and (6) revolution, establishing a new paradigm. &amp;nbsp;(Kl 114)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hacking thoroughly rejects the most subjectivist aspects of many readings of Kuhn: the idea that scientists inhabiting different paradigms also literally inhabit different worlds. Hacking doesn't believe that Kuhn actually believes this, or even unambiguously asserts it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are many passages in Kuhn's original text that are worth pulling out again. Here is one, on the gap between observation and scientific beliefs:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Observation and experience can and must drastically restrict the range of admissible scientific belief, else there would be no science. But they cannot alone determine a particular body of such belief. An apparently arbitrary element, compounded of personal and historical accident, is always a formative ingredient of the beliefs espoused by a given scientific community at a given time. (4)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Effective research scarcely begins before a scientific community thinks it has acquired firm answers to questions like the following: What are the fundamental entities of which the universe is composed? How do these interact with each other and with the senses? What questions may legitimately be asked about such entities and what techniques employed in seeking solutions? (4)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These passages make it clear that Kuhn does in fact think that a scientific community possesses a set of unifying but contestable &amp;nbsp;beliefs -- what many of us now mean by a paradigm. And this seems more pervasive and comprehensive than Hacking's analysis would seem to allow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I first read Kuhn as an undergraduate in 1969 or 1970, and I confess that my own understanding of his meaning concerning scientific knowledge and reasoning gravitated towards the more anti-objectivist reading that Hacking rejects. I understood paradigms as sets of semi-articulated assumptions about science, the world, and the instruments that hung together as a community-dependent worldview; a worldview that could not be directly empirically evaluated. And I understood incommensurablity to mean that scientists within these mental frameworks arrived at empirical judgments and theories that could not be strictly compared across communities, because their underlying conceptual structures were systematically different. I had read Quine on the indeterminacy of translation at roughly the same time, and I understood incommensurablity in analogy with indeterminacy across language communities. (Kuhn's preface to the book makes it clear that he too had read Quine, though in the 1950s and therefore prior to the publication of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262518317/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0262518317&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Word and Object&lt;/a&gt; (1960); kl 550.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I also understood Kuhn to hold that standards of scientific reasoning were likewise dependent on the mental frameworks of the research communities -- with the result that some disagreements among physicists or biologists could not be resolved on the basis of standards of scientific reasoning or method. There was no "paradigm-independent" scientific method, no community-neutral standard of rational preferability.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It may be that Hacking is right, and that Kuhn never intended to support these radical claims about the limits of scientific rationality. But whether he did or not, the position is an intelligible one, and thinkers as diverse as Althusser and Feyerabend have advocated it. Frederick Jameson's title, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691013160/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0691013160&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;The Prison-House of Language: A Critical Account of Structuralism and Russian Formalism&lt;/a&gt;, picturesquely captures the core idea.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Structure of Scientific Revolutions&lt;/i&gt; richly rewards a rereading fifty years after its original publication. And as is true of so many deeply original works, we are likely to find different things most striking today than we did on first reading decades ago.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Image: Shanxi countryside&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1978 China's government initiated a major change in the agricultural economy. It began a rapid transition from communal agriculture to the household responsibility system, which returned the responsibilities and incentives associated with farming to the farmer rather than the commune. This was the beginning of the market-friendly reforms that led to the transformation of agriculture, industry, and transport in a remarkably short time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These market-oriented reforms have also stimulated a continuing economic revolution in China, with growth rates exceeding 10% in many years and an intensive period of infrastructure build-out (roads, high speed rail, telecommunications).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Much has transpired in the Chinese countryside since 1978. Rural incomes have risen; significant numbers of rural people have transitioned from farming into better-paying market and logistical activities; and many millions of young people have exited the countryside in search of work in manufacturing and construction. On balance, how has this tumultuous 35 years affected the quality of life for China's rural population?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 1990 William Hinton offered his own predictions about the effects of the rural reforms in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0853457948/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0853457948&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;The Great Reversal: The Privatization of China, 1978-1989&lt;/a&gt;. Hinton believed the future was dire for China's peasants, as they would be squeezed by market forces into even lower-productivity farming techniques and the wealth of the countryside would be extracted by urban elites. Hinton was a continuing supporter of collective agriculture because he believed it permitted economies of scale and more reliable support for the welfare of the people in the countryside. It seems that no one in China continues to advocate this view.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Deng Xiaoping took a different perspective. He believed that all of China would benefit from the accumulation of wealth created by market incentives. His famous words -- "To get rich is glorious" -- legitimated the workings of the market in creating inequalities. And he evidently believed that these processes of economic growth and market incentives would be good for the rural sector as well as the urban sector.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So how has it worked out? How has China's agricultural economy performed in the past three decades? Is China food-self-sufficient? Have rural people gained income? Is rural poverty falling significantly? What is the trend in the quality of life of China's rural populations? And what happened to the range of income inequalities in the countryside?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are a few important data points.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First, it appears to be true that China has made rapid progress in reducing poverty in its population. According to Li Xiaoyun's tables below, just under 13% of China's population lives in extreme poverty at incomes lower than $1.25 per day in 2011. (The next three slides are taken from an extensive presentation on China's poverty strategies by &amp;nbsp;Professor Li Xiaoyun, China Agricultural University;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.ctc-health.org.cn/file/PD2012070904.pdf"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.) This is a dramatic reduction from an estimate in excess of 80% at this level in the late 1970s. This means that rural incomes have risen substantially since 1978.&lt;br /&gt;

Moreover, there have been nationally coordinated programs of poverty alleviation that have been supported by meaningful levels of central and provincial resources.&lt;br /&gt;

Second, it is also true that China's income inequalities have increased sharply during the same period. The share of income flowing to the poorest 40% has fallen from 20% to 14% from 1990 to 2009. Studies indicate that the Gini coefficient for income inequality has risen sharply during that time. It seems likely that wealth inequalities have increased even more. Here are charts documenting the rise of income inequalities in China from the 2005 &lt;i&gt;China Human Development Report&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/national/asiathepacific/china/name,3270,en.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br /&gt;

The following figure documents the overall rise in urban/rural income inequalities in China since 1997 extending the data represented in Fig. 2.2 above through 2010&amp;nbsp;(Liu M., link). Interestingly, this graph suggests that urban/rural inequalities leveled off in about 2003.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Third, food security has improved. China is a net exporter of rice (&lt;a href="http://irri.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;amp;view=item&amp;amp;id=8741:rice-in-china"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) and has substantially increasing its production of pigs and poultry, and it has not suffered famine or extensive malnutrition since the Great Leap Forward famine of 1959. Nutritional levels throughout poor areas have improved in the past twenty years, although there are still significant levels of underweight or stunted children under 5 (fig. 3.14, CHDR 2005).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What has been less visible to the western public is the dynamics of life quality that these changes have created in the countryside. What is needed is disaggregated studies of quality-of-life indicators like education, health, nutrition, and longevity. World Bank reports and China's own major statistical reports do not highlight these kinds of data. However, the UNDP has prepared six triennial reports on China's performance with respect to the Human Development Index (&lt;a href="http://hdr.undp.org/xmlsearch/reportSearch?c=n:CHINA&amp;amp;k=&amp;amp;t=*&amp;amp;y=*"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), and it turns out that Chinese researchers are in fact doing careful work on the task of measuring these characteristics in rural areas. Three leading Chinese scholars focused on poverty alleviation (Wu Guobao, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Liu Minquan, Peking Univerisity; Li Xiaoyun, China Agricultural University) provide a good snapshot into a world of policy research currently underway in China.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How are the government's pronouncements about poverty alleviation viewed by the Chinese public? I had a very interesting conversation with a man in his thirties in Taiyuan, Shanxi on this question. He is employed in a semi-professional job. His view was very skeptical. He believes the government says it is working toward helping the poor and reducing inequalities, but he doesn't think these efforts are very broad. His view is that anti-poverty programs are directed towards just a few locations and a relatively small part of the rural population. And he thinks it is very unfair that the inequalities between rich and poor are increasing so rapidly. When I asked him what he thought the greatest problems were that China faces, he listed these: a one-party state that gives ordinary people no voice in the issues they care about; a lack of freedom of expression; and the unfairness of increasing inequalities between rich and poor. This was a very frank assessment by one person which perhaps sheds some light on how many young people are thinking in China today.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(Here is a 2003 volume on poverty alleviation in China published by the Development Studies Network in Australia, including a number of valuable research articles on the subject; &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0CDIQFjAA&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crawford.anu.edu.au%2Frmap%2Fdevnet%2Fdevnet%2Fdb-61.pdf&amp;amp;ei=ZY2uUYfWAsKVygHzyoAI&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNG6IRzR1WBqpFQpsYgSb3G3MOJ5SA&amp;amp;sig2=0ypuAAqadAzVIwGNzMuVPQ&amp;amp;bvm=bv.47380653,d.aWM"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;. The China Health and Nutrition Survey conducted by the Carolina Population Center and the National Institute of Nutrition and Food Safety at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention is also a valuable data source; &lt;a href="http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/china"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I'm finding myself increasingly distressed at this week's revelations about government surveillance of citizens' communications and Internet activity. First was the revelation in the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;of a wholesale FISA court order to Verizon to provide all customer "meta-data" for a three-month period -- and the clarification that this order is simply a renewal of orders that have been in place since 2007. (One would certainly assume that there are similar orders for other communications providers.) And commentators are now spelling out how comprehensive this data is about each of us -- who we call, who those people call, when, where, … This comprehensive data collection permits the mother of all social network analysis projects -- to reconstruct the widening circles of persons with whom person X is associated. This is its value from an intelligence point of view; but it is also a dark, brooding risk to the constitutional rights and liberties of all of us.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Second is the even more shocking disclosure -- also in the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; -- of an NSA program called PRISM that claims (based on the secret powerpoint training document published by the &lt;i&gt;Guardian&lt;/i&gt;) to have reached agreements with the major Internet companies to permit direct government access to their servers, without the intermediary of warrants and requests for specific information. (The companies have denied knowledge of such a program; but it's hard to see how the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; document could be a simple fake.) And the document claims that the program gives the intelligence agencies direct access to users' emails, videos, chats, search histories, and other forms of Internet activity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Among the political rights that we hold most basic are the rights of political expression and association. It doesn't matter much if a government agency is able to work out the network graph of people with whom I am associated around the project of youth soccer in my neighborhood. But if I were an Occupy Wall Street organizer, I would be VERY concerned about the fact that government is able to work out the full graph of my associates, their associates, and times and place of communication. At the least this fact has a chilling effect on political organization and protest -- both of which are constitutionally protected rights of US citizens. At the worst it makes possible police intervention and suppression based on the "intelligence" that is gathered. And the activities of the FBI in the 1960s against legal Civil Rights organizations make it clear that agencies are fully capable of undertaking actions in excess of their legal mandate. For that matter, the rogue activities of an IRS office with respect to the tax-exempt status of conservative political organizations illustrates the same point in the same news cycle!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The whole point of a constitution is to express clearly and publicly what rights citizens have, and to place bright-line limits on the scope of government action. But the revelations of this week make one doubt whether a constitutional limitation has any meaning anymore. These data collection and surveillance programs are wrapped in tight secrecy -- providers are not permitted to make public the requests that have been presented to them. So the public has no legitimate way of knowing what kind of information collection, surveillance, and intelligence activity is being undertaken with respect to their activities. In the name of homeland security, the evidence says that government is prepared to transgress what we thought of as "rights" with abandon, and with massive force. (The NSA data center under construction in Utah gives some sense of the massiveness of these data collection efforts.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We are assured by government spokespersons that appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure and preserve the constitutional rights of all of us. But there are two problems with those assurances, both having to do with secrecy. Citizens are not provided with any account by government about how these programs are designed to work, and what safeguards are incorporated. And citizens are prevented from knowing what the exercise and effects of these programs are -- by the prohibition against telecom providers of giving any public information about the nature of requests that are being made under these programs. So secrecy prevents the very possibility of citizen knowledge and believable judicial oversight. By design there is no transparency about these crucial new tools and data collection methods.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All of this makes one think that the science and technology of encryption is politically crucial in the Internet age, for preserving some of our most basic rights of legal political activity. Being able to securely encrypt one's communications so only the intended recipients can gain access to them sounds like a crucial right of self-protection against the surveillance state. And being able to anonymize one's location and IP address -- through services like TOR router systems -- also seems like an important ability that everyone ought to consider making use of. Voice services like Skype seem to be fully compromised -- Microsoft, the owner of Skype, was the first company to accept the PRISM program, according to the secret powerpoint. But perhaps new Internet-based voice technologies using "trust no one" encryption and TOR routers will return the balance to the user. &amp;nbsp;Intelligence and law enforcement agencies sometimes suggest that only people with something to hide would use an anonymizer in their interactions on the Web. But given the MASSIVE personalized data collection that government is engaged in, it would seem that every citizen has an interest in preserving his or her privacy to whatever extent possible. Privacy is an important human value in general; and it is a crucial value when it comes to the exercise of our constitutional rights of expression and association.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Government has surely overstepped through creation of these programs of data collection and surveillance; and it is hard to see how to put the genie back in the bottle. One step would be the creation of much more stringent legal limits on the data collection capacity of agencies like NSA (and commercial agencies, for that matter). But how can we trust that those limits will be respected by agencies that are accustomed to working in the dark?&lt;br /&gt;

John Doris argues in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521608902/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0521608902&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Lack of Character: Personality and Moral Behavior&lt;/a&gt; that the basic theory of action associated with virtue ethics and the theory of moral character is most likely incorrect. The character theory maintains that individuals have stable traits that lead them to behave similarly in a range of relevant but differing circumstances. A person with the traits of honesty or compassion will behave truthfully or benevolently in a range of circumstances, when it is easy to do so and when it is more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Situationism is the competing view that maintains that people's actions are more sensitive to features of the situation of action than to enduring underlying traits. Doris largely endorses situationism&lt;span style="-webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(175, 192, 227, 0.230469); -webkit-composition-frame-color: rgba(77, 128, 180, 0.230469); -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969);"&gt;&amp;nbsp;-- for example, he cites experiments showing that subjects make different choices when confronted with a situation of a need for help by another person, depending on whether or not the subject recently found a small amount of money. Apparently situations that induce a "good mood" make a large difference in benevolent behavior.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Rachana Kamtekar&lt;span style="-webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(175, 192, 227, 0.230469); -webkit-composition-frame-color: rgba(77, 128, 180, 0.230469); -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969);"&gt;&amp;nbsp;does a good job of explaining situationism as presented by moral philosophers such as Gilbert Harman; &lt;a href="http://www.u.arizona.edu/~kamtekar/papers/situationism.pdf"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;. Kamtekar summarizes situationism in these terms:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
&lt;span style="-webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(175, 192, 227, 0.230469); -webkit-composition-frame-color: rgba(77, 128, 180, 0.230469); -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969);"&gt;Situationist social psychologists tell us that information about people’s distinctive character traits, opinions, attitudes, values, or past behavior is not as useful for determining what they will do as is information about the details of their situations. (458)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Doris's argument is almost entirely grounded on the findings of experimental psychology drawn from a number of experiments designed to observe how people will behave when faced with a particular situation involving the wellbeing of others. Particularly well known are the Milgram experiment and the Stanford prison experiment performed by Philip Zimbardo and colleagues, which Doris discusses extensively; but there are many others with similar results that have been performed within social psychology as well.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It isn't Doris's view that there are no personality traits at all, but rather that they are small and context-specific in contrast to the general character traits cited in the literature of virtue ethics. "I allow for the possibility of temporally stable, situation-particular, 'local' traits that are associated with important individual differences in behavior" (25). In particular, he takes issue with the "globalism" of many theories of moral virtues and character. Those theories typically make three important assumptions about the virtues of character that Doris finds to be contradicted by the evidence of empirical research in psychology:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consistency.&lt;/b&gt; Character and personality traits are reliably manifested in trait-relevant behavior across a diversity of trait-relevant eliciting conditions...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stability.&lt;/b&gt; Character and personality traits are reliably manifested in trait-relevant behaviors over iterated trials of similar trait-relevant eliciting conditions.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evaluative integration.&lt;/b&gt; In a given character or personality the occurrence of a trait with a particular evaluative valence is probabilistically related to the occurrence of other traits with similar evaluative valences. (23)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
He concludes that these three features are not supported by the evidence:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Systematic observation typically fails to reveal the behavioral patterns expected by globalism; &lt;i&gt;globalist conceptions of personality are empirically inadequate&lt;/i&gt;. (23)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There are several things about Doris's approach that I like. His insistence that moral philosophy needs to be attentive to the findings of empirical psychological research is compelling. His care in treating the philosophical theories he challenges in thoughtful detail is appealing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div style="-webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(175, 192, 227, 0.230469); -webkit-composition-frame-color: rgba(77, 128, 180, 0.230469); -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);"&gt;
What Doris doesn't provide is any kind of theory of the actor of his own. He doesn't favor the idea that actors possess character traits; but we are left in the dark about how he thinks our actions actually proceed. Is it a form of calculation? Is it the result of intuition and snap judgment (along the lines of Daniel Kahneman's arguments in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374533555/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0374533555&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/a&gt;)? Doris doesn't offer an alternative theory of how the actor processes a situation and arrives at an action. And in fact, it's somewhat difficult to see how we would characterize any human behavior without recourse to something like character traits and dispositions. Is every moment a new occasion for spontaneous choice or rational calculation? Is action at a moment simply the result of unconscious prior stimulation and a little bit of cognition about the current situation?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Doris discusses a possible solution to this worry, the theory of "social cognitivism" (76 ff.).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
[Social cognitivists] understand behavior as a function of each person's "cognitive-affective personality system": the organization of beliefs, feelings, goals, competencies, and strategies that is supposed to support "stable and distinctive patterns of intraindividual variability in behavior". (77)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I don't know whether the social cognitivists (e.g. Walter Mischel and Yuichi Shoda) succeed in offering a compelling empirical case for their view; but at least it provides a somewhat developed theory of the actor. In any case, it is not a framework that Doris endorses. And that seems to leave his account with a large hole in the middle: we would like to have an answer to the question, how &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; actors process the situations they encounter and arrive at actions to perform? What is the theory of the actor that is most plausible given a commitment to situationalism?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here is Rachana Kamtekar's most fundamental objection to the kinds of arguments offered by Doris and others:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
It should by now be clear that the experiments which ﬁnd character traits to correlate poorly with behavior rely on a very particular conception of a character trait: as an isolable and nonrational disposition to manifest a given stereotypical behavior that differs from the behavior of others and is fairly situation insensitive. (477)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
In fact, Kamtekar suggests that situationism in the extreme is incompatible with almost every form of moral or practical reasoning:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Perhaps, if situationism is true, then the answer to the practical question “what can I do to take charge of my situation?”is“nothing”— the features of situations that determine behavior are so subtle and surprising that no ordinary rational strategies could enable us to be masters of our situations. But such pessimism is premature, and if it were ever to become warranted, then it is not only virtue ethics and the notion of character that we would have to jettison, but the power of practical reasoning. (491)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Pure situationism seems to run deeply contrary to our ordinary, commonsense understandings of how and why people behave as they do. Doris doesn't have too much regard for commonsense when it comes to understanding behavior, though he does address the topic. But if we think about the people we've observed most closely in professional contexts, personal life, and politics, it seems hard to avoid the sober conclusion that these individuals do indeed have "character", for better or worse, and that their characters differ. This one can be counted on to deflect responsibility for bad outcomes in his or her division; that one is solidly committed to his spouse; and that one is forever expedient in appealing for votes. People differ in these ways in our ordinary experience; so it is difficult to find the experiments of Milgram or Zimbardo sufficient to erase our reliance on the idea of persistent character traits in ordinary people. (Could we design experiments that seek to evaluate characteristics like "avoids responsibility," "honors familial commitments," "acts out of devotion to principle"?)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;image: Thomas Hughes, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0801846145/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0801846145&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society, 1880-1930&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of the things that I find most interesting in social development is the discovery of unexpected linkages between innovations in one field and outcomes in another.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here is a somewhat hypothetical example. Improvement of long distance banking transactions in Qing China produces an increase in the frequency of rebellion. How so? Because the long distance transport of merchant silver created a sub-culture of rural bandits preying on merchant travelers. The creation of letters of credit reduced these opportunities, and under-employed bandit gangs were more easily recruited into rebel forces. (This corresponds loosely to arguments offered by Liz Perry in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804711755/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0804711755&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Rebels and Revolutionaries in North China, 1845-1945&lt;/a&gt; concerning the dialectic between predation and rebellion, though I've speculated a bit about the banking part.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The general idea here is that large changes in social systems of interaction -- roads, railways, telegraph systems, etc. -- often create new opportunities for social actors that were not anticipated by designers but that have large social consequences. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are some examples of these kinds of effects. Discovery of diamonds in a region leads to severe deforestation (as diamonds stimulate violent conflict, leading to large refugee flows, leading to new destructive uses of forests). Extension of trolleys in the Boston suburbs leads to an increase in the frequency of spikes in disease mortality (as carriers move around the region more frequently). Growth of the electric power grid in Pennsylvania results in a decline in church attendance (as young people find other social options in well-lit towns and cities).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am led to think about these kinds of effects because of the rapidity of system change in China today. The train system, the extension of video surveillance, changes in social security provisions, the ever-growing population of internal migrants -- all these processes are likely to have unexpected and novel consequences. And as complexity theory tells us, systems with multiple interlinked causal processes are vulnerable to abrupt changes of state as causal factors stimulate unexpected behaviors. This is familiar in ecological research, but it seems equally applicable to the social world. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One consequence of this line of thought is that we need to be cautious about predictions of the future that depend on smooth extrapolations of existing trends. In the case of China, perhaps the most confident prediction we can make is that there will be many surprises in the coming decades. &lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Understandingsociety/~4/QunwwS3vY1k" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/feeds/4986247373628751851/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2013/06/unexpected-linkages.html#comment-form" title="1 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4058766287077382431/posts/default/4986247373628751851?v=2" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4058766287077382431/posts/default/4986247373628751851?v=2" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Understandingsociety/~3/QunwwS3vY1k/unexpected-linkages.html" title="Unexpected linkages" /><author><name>Daniel Little</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/105264573439237469924</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" width="32" height="32" src="//lh6.googleusercontent.com/--y4vBzEEeIo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/YOQ20no6wko/s512-c/photo.jpg" /></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VCXPOK3J-rU/UaqgvdH-wuI/AAAAAAAAIA8/Zfw78hTC7ms/s72-c/electric+penn+2_1.JPG" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total>1</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2013/06/unexpected-linkages.html</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry gd:etag="W/&quot;CUACQnw9fyp7ImA9WhFTEU4.&quot;"><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4058766287077382431.post-6566306260654658583</id><published>2013-05-28T22:22:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2013-06-01T20:42:43.267-04:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2013-06-01T20:42:43.267-04:00</app:edited><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="CAT_China" /><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="agriculture" /><title>Forum on Rural Areas and Peasants</title><content type="html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I've just spent an interesting several days in Wuhan at a conference on China's rural transformation. It was a genuinely productive conference, involving experts from Japan, Great Britain, United States, and China. The central topic was the process of agricultural modernization and urbanization currently underway in China, and some of the strategies the government is taking to steer this process. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The most interesting contributions for me were by Chinese researchers from leading universities and research units, who gave an insight into the ways that Chinese scholars and policy makers are thinking about these crucial processes. The largest takeaway was the degree of effort being given to alleviation of rural poverty, by both researchers and government agencies. I'll give more details on this in an upcoming post. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to my own contribution to the conference on the crucial role of social science research during this process, I was invited to give related lectures to several large groups of students at two universities. As on similar occasions in the past, I was energized by the interest and reflection these students showed in the issues of social transformation in China that I was treating. The questions were very good. (All of my presentations were translated by two talented students from Central China Normal University.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As part of this trip I was able to take a short excursion to Henan Province to get exposure to some important developments in Chinese agriculture. We visited two large commercial farms specializing in organic vegetables. The first farm occupies about two thousand acres, assembled through agreements with peasant farmers and local government. The corporation does not "own" the land but has rights of use for five-year periods. It employs about one thousand farm workers, often from the families of the original farms that gave been consolidated. (I estimated about two hundred people working in the fields we saw.) The produce is of high quality and farm management is highly professional. It also produces wheat on rotation with vegetable fields.  This farm is one of about eight farms of similar size owned by the company in different provinces "to balance risk and seasonality". The company is actively exploring establishment of a similar farm in California. The other farm was similar in size but was described as a cooperative in which peasant farmers maintained a larger degree of involvement in the farm process. This farm will produce specialty items including fruit, vegetables, and blueberries. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This seems like a good indication of one likely future for Chinese agriculture: consolidated land, moderate level of mechanization, expert management, high productivity. Our group was able to talk with a local man in a  nearby village, the uncle of one of the faculty hosts. He was a former headmaster of the village school who had returned to farming after retirement. His home in the village was concrete block, nicely furnished with five rooms and a small courtyard.  We asked him whether the peasants whose land had been absorbed by the consolidation for these large farms were satisfied. He was adamant they were because it permitted some level of income from the lease while permitting young people to leave the village for higher income in the urban sector (as part of China's large class of migrant workers in urban industry and construction).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All in all, a very stimulating exposure to one of the most important processes underway in China today and for the next few decades.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1smVtQKMj6I/UZq0Xgv0E4I/AAAAAAAAH-8/DZMoYu-TCQw/s640/blogger-image--1433167011.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1smVtQKMj6I/UZq0Xgv0E4I/AAAAAAAAH-8/DZMoYu-TCQw/s320/blogger-image--1433167011.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We can examine social life at many levels of granularity -- from ordinary individual social behavior to small groups to cities and regions to the global system of communication and extraction. Is there any basis for thinking one level is better than another for the social sciences?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are two kinds of considerations that might be used as grounds for answering this question. One is about scientific feasibility and the other is about explanatory scope. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The feasibility line goes this way. It might be that higher level social phenomena are substantially less orderly than lower level phenomena. This means that we might be able to arrive at more confident and comprehensible analysis at the lower level than the higher level. Features of indeterminacy, contingency, and complexity might mean that we can't expect to have strong and empirically well supported analyses of ensembles like cities or trading systems. And we might find that studies of individual-level social behavior are more tractable and empirically defensible. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The explanatory scope consideration cuts in the opposite direction. We would like to be able to explain processes like urbanization, ethnic conflict, and the social role of religion. These processes are very interesting, and they are consequential as well. So we would like to have some reliable hypotheses about some of the causal dynamics that animate them.  And studies that focus on individual-level processes may not shed much light on these higher-level processes. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So tractability perhaps pushes us towards the lower level, while an appetite for explanatory scope pushes us towards theorizing and investigating higher levels. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is something appealing about a definition of the social sciences that tries to answer the actor-level kind of question: what are the drivers of real social behavior, in a variety of settings? What are the springs of individual action? How do environment and experience influence people's actions? This approach would fall within the sociological theory of the actor; it would largely overlap with social and developmental psychology, with a scoop of ethnomethodology on the side. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And this approach wouldn't be wholly limited to the individual. Some of the learning we do about cooperation, aggression, and social cognition might well provide a basis for explanation of high-level social phenomena such as ethnic conflict or the spread of agricultural practices. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But it also seems credible that we can learn some important things about the higher-level processes and structures as well. Political scientists have some robust ideas about how institutions work. Economists have succeeded in identifying some of the dynamics of trading systems and technology change. Urban sociologists are able to discern some of the processes of neighborhood transformation. So it is clear that there are higher level social processes, structures, and systems that are amenable to empirical and theoretical study.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A nice conjunction of research projects that illustrate this point can be found in the study of modern cities. Al Young (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/069112700X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=069112700X&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;The Minds of Marginalized Black Men: Making Sense of Mobility, Opportunity, and Future Life Chances&lt;/a&gt;) and Loic Wacquant (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0745631258/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0745631258&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Urban Outcasts: A Comparative Sociology of Advanced Marginality&lt;/a&gt;) provide ground-level studies of the actors who make up the inner city. Robert Sampson's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/022605568X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=022605568X&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Great American City: Chicago and the Enduring Neighborhood Effect&lt;/a&gt; offers a meso-level account of how neighborhoods work, and some of the causal relations that can be discerned at the level of the neighborhood. Thomas Hughes' &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0801846145/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0801846145&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Networks of Power: Electrification in Western Society, 1880-1930&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates how a major technology like electric power is both structured and structuring within the urban systems in which it is introduced. And Saskia Sassen's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691070636/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0691070636&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;The Global City: New York, London, Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;provides an account of systematic interrelations among cities in a global network. Each of these studies sheds light on how cities work; they do so at different levels of granularity; and each study brings with it an admirable degree of empirical and theoretical rigor. &amp;nbsp;Each of them tells us something novel and non-trivial about how cities function. (There are prior postings on each of these authors: &lt;a href="http://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2012/07/thinking-poverty-in-inner-city.html"&gt;Young&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2013/04/urban-marginality.html"&gt;Wacquant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2009/01/technology-and-culture.html"&gt;Hughes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2008/05/cities.html"&gt;Sassen&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This suggests something pretty moderate and pluralistic: that there is valid and important social research to be done at many levels of social organization. We won't find a unifying science of everything. But we can do social science research at many levels in ways that respect the heterogeneity of the social world while also shedding light on the workings of some important social and causal processes. There is no privileged level of research to which we should limit our social-science gaze.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;
&lt;img border="0" height="274" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pr2_hCNGzaQ/UZlIRNyLQ9I/AAAAAAAAH-o/5nNGoCSQyHY/s400/blogger-image--838323968.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The key idea of moral character is that the actions individuals choose are influenced by enduring features of their mentality. Unlike the situationist who looks at each situation of choice as a solution to achieving goals given current circumstances (Gilbert Harman, "Moral philosophy meets social psychology" &lt;a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~harman/Papers/Virtue.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;; John Doris, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521608902/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0521608902&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Lack of Character: Personality and Moral Behavior&lt;/a&gt;), a character theory maintains that choice derives in part by perduring features of the self. We might say that an individual's choices over time reflect a "style" of action that corresponds to these underlying features of personality and character.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An example will be helpful. Let's say that fidelity is the virtue of honoring one's commitments. A person who has acquired the habit of fidelity will be more likely to keep promises even in circumstances where there are short-term advantages in breaking them. So fidelity is a motivational counterweight to impulse and opportunism. There are other counterweights that also work -- for example, what Elster describes as foresight is also a bulwark against myopic opportunism. The foresightful person is able to take longterm interests into account and thereby avoid the error of myopia. But an embodied habit of fidelity does the work well. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This brief example suggests two kinds of questions. First, do individuals actually demonstrate the workings of such a virtue in their actual behavior, and are there observable differences in the strength of this factor across individuals and groups? And second, how does this character trait develop in the course of maturation in typical individuals? What circumstances or experiences either strengthen or weaken the trait? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Personality psychology and social psychology offer experimental means for exploring the first set of questions. Much of this research takes the form of behavioral experiments along the lines of the Milgram experiment, apparently demonstrating that human beings are more ready to behave badly than we would have expected. (This experiment is described in the Harman article mentioned above.) &amp;nbsp;These experiments involve selection of a set of volunteer subjects and a carefully designed task that will probe their behavioral dispositions. Here is a study that attempts to measure the distribution of trust across a population; &lt;a href="http://blogs.iq.harvard.edu/sss/archives/Social%20Trust_Yamagishi%20Trust%20&amp;amp;%20Gullibility.pdf"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A different approach is offered by David Winter, a personality psychologist who studies personality traits at a distance -- historical figures and political leaders. Winter offers an accessible summary of his research in "Things I've Learned About Personality From&amp;nbsp;Studying Political Leaders at a Distance" (link). Here is how he describes the "distance" point:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Denied direct access, those who study political leaders, past and present, have had to develop a variety of indirect means for measuring personality ‘‘at a distance'' (see, for example, the recent collections of articles in Feldman &amp;amp; Valenty, 2001, and Valenty &amp;amp; Feldman, 2002). Some researchers look for patterns in known bio-graphical facts (Post, 2003), perhaps using formal systems of clinical diagnostic categories (Immelman, 1993, 2002). Others ask experts to rate leaders by using standard personality rating scales (Rubenzer, Faschingbauer, &amp;amp; Ones, 1996, 2000) or Q-sorts (Kowert, 1996). There is, however, one kind of data from political leaders that is produced and preserved in abundance—namely, words. Thus, many at-a-distance researchers do content analyses of leaders' verbal or written texts: speeches, interviews, and even government documents (see Winter, 1992). It is thereby possible to measure a wide variety of personality characteristics of otherwise inaccessible people: for example, integrative complexity (Suedfeld &amp;amp; Rank, 1976), explanatory style (Satterfield &amp;amp; Seligman, 1994), nationalism, and internal control of events (Hermann, 1980)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The second question has been treated in very different ways. One aspect of character formation, we sometimes believe, stems from the strong experiences we have had in our lives. Another view is that our character took shape through exposure to the actions of role models. An interesting current approach to this question is provided by an interesting recent book in naturalistic ethics by Mark Alfano, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1107026725/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1107026725&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Character as Moral Fiction&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="-webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(175, 192, 227, 0.230469); -webkit-composition-frame-color: rgba(77, 128, 180, 0.230469); -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969);"&gt;Alfano repeats a call for what I refer to as a theory of the actor:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote style="-webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(175, 192, 227, 0.230469); -webkit-composition-frame-color: rgba(77, 128, 180, 0.230469); -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);"&gt;
The clarion call of the revival of virtue ethics was Elizabeth Anscombe's feisty "Modern Moral Philosophy" (1958). She claimed that it is not worthwhile to do ethics until we possess a proper philosophy of psychology -- one that provides a theory of reasons, motives, and dispositions inter alia. (17)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div style="-webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(175, 192, 227, 0.230469); -webkit-composition-frame-color: rgba(77, 128, 180, 0.230469); -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);"&gt;
He takes a provocative view on the status of virtues in real human actors.&amp;nbsp;He argues that virtues are shaped in the individual by the commendations and criticisms that are offered by the individual's proximate community during development and adulthood.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Traits like callousness, courage, greed, dishonesty, generosity, and tact are dispositions to act and react in characteristic ways. (2-3)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I shall argue that though most people do not think, feel, and act in ways that traditional normative theory would describe as virtuous ..., we should still attribute the virtues ... to one another because these attributions tend to function as self-fulfilling prophecies. Calling someone honest ... will lead him to think, feel, and act more honestly in the future. (9) When this happens, I call it &lt;i&gt;factitious virtue.&lt;/i&gt; (10)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
What is clear is that there is a very large domain for empirical research that is created around the moral psychology associated with character and virtue, and that this research is important for the purpose of refining our theory of the actor. Philosophers, sociologists, and psychologists have an interest in arriving at the most illuminating research in this area possible.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
At various points since the death of Karl Marx in 1883 his work has been regarded as a dead issue -- no longer relevant, too ideological, methodologically flawed, too rooted in the nineteenth century. And yet each of these periods of extinction has been followed by a resurgence of interest in Marx's ideas, as new generations try to make sense of the tough and often cruel social conditions in which they find themselves. What are the important dimensions of theory that Marx presented through his writings? And how can any of these be considered valuable in trying to come to grips with the global, capitalist, turbulent, unequal, violent world that we now inhabit?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We might say that there are a small handful of key theoretical frameworks that Marx advocated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Materialism as a methodology for social science.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Social change is driven by material circumstances, the forces and relations of production. This encompasses the property system and the ensemble of technologies present in a given level of society. Materialism denies that ideas and thought drive social change; so religion, patriotism, nationalism, and ideologies of patriarchy are epiphenomena rather than originating causes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emphasis on the primacy of property and class.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Sociologists and historians want to explain processes of social change. Marx puts it forward that the economic interests created by the property system in a given society create powerful foundations for collective social action. &amp;nbsp;Those who occupy positions of advantage within a given set of property relations want to do what they can to preserve those relations; and those who are disadvantaged by the property relations have a latent interest in mobilizing to change those relations. Persons who share a location in the property system constitute a class, and their interests are systematically different from those in other such positions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A sketch of a theory of consciousness and culture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Institutions of consciousness and culture play a role in stabilizing and attacking the most important relations of domination in a society. Educational institutions, it is argued, prepare young people for their specific roles in society -- workers, managers, elites, sub-proletarians. So struggles over the content and form of the institutions of enculturation can be expected to be polarized along class lines. Less directly, Marxists like Gramsci have postulated that worldviews reflect life experiences; so elites create cultural worlds that are quite distinct from those imagined by subordinate groups.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A diagnosis of social ills including exploitation, alienation, and dehumanization of social relations. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Exploitation has to do with the flow of wealth and material goods through the property system from producers to property-owners. Alienation has to do with the loss of autonomy and self-control that individuals have within a capitalist structure. Marx's distinctive addition to this idea is that this loss of autonomy has psychic consequences -- disaffection, lack of self-respect, depression. The dehumanization of social relations follows from the structure of the capitalist workplace -- workers and bosses, each related to the other through the workings of a command system. Wittgentstein got it right when he described the "slab" language game: the boss says "slab", and the worker produces a slab. There is nothing "I-thou" about this relation (Buber, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743201337/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0743201337&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;I and Thou&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A theory of several distinct modes of production.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Marx believes that history takes the form of a succession of separable and structurally distinct modes of production: ancient slavery, feudalism, and capitalism differ by the structure of the production system, the property system, and the technologies that each embodied. Marx's most extensive analysis of social formations is his treatment of the capitalist mode of production in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140445684/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0140445684&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Capital: Volume 1: A Critique of Political Economy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and the writings that were posthumously edited and published as volumes 2 and 3 of &lt;i&gt;Capital&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A common thread through these framing ideas is the perspective of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;critique&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: a critical intelligence trying to understand why modern society produces such human misery. But even from the perspective of critique -- the perspective that tries to diagnose and understand the systemic flaws of contemporary society -- Marxism leaves quite a bit of terrain untouched: gender relations, racism, nationalism, and religious hatred, for example. Marxism doesn't do a good job of explaining a regime of sexual violence (rape in India); it doesn't have much to contribute to the rise of fascism; it doesn't have resources for understanding Islamo-phobia and hatred. &amp;nbsp;So Marxism is not a comprehensive theory of modern social failings; and we might say that its emphasis on economic conflict eclipses other forms of domination in ways that are actually harmful to our ability to improve our social relations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Geoff Boucher takes up the issue of the continuing relevance of Marx in the contemporary world in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1844655210/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1844655210&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Understanding Marxism&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Here is how he opens the book:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Today, radical thinking about social alternatives stands under prohibition. According to defenders of the neoliberal transformation of every facet of human existence into a market, Marxism has failed…. Marx is dead; Marxism is finished -- and it must stay that way. (1)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
But Boucher rejects this neoliberal consensus.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Marxism as an intellectual movement has been one of the most important and fertile contributions to twentieth-century thought. The influence of Marxism has been felt in every discipline, in the social sciences and interpretive humanities, from philosophy, through sociology and history, to literature. (2)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Here are the core reasons that Boucher offers for thinking that Marxism is still relevant in the twenty-first century:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marxism is the most serious normative social-theoretical challenge to liberal forms of freedom that does not at the same time reject the modern world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marxism is the most sustained effort so far to think the present historically and to reflexively grasp thought itself within its socio-historical context. (2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
And later:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Marxism is a distinctively historical theory that normatively challenges liberalism in a way no other modern theory does. (3)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Much of Boucher's book contributes to one of two intellectual aims: to give a clear exposition of the most important of Marx's theoretical ideas; and to explicate the several "Marxisms" that followed in the twentieth century. The successive Marxisms take up the bulk of the book, with chapters on Classical Marxism, Hegelian Marxism, The Frankfurt School, Structural Marxism, Analytical Marxism, Critical Theory, and Post-Marxism. So the book provides very extensive explication of the theoretical ideas and developments that have grown out of the Marxist tradition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What Boucher doesn't really provide is a clear rationale, based on contemporary sociology and history, for the conclusions he wants us to share about the continuing utility of Marxism as a framework for understanding the present and future. We don't get the reasoning that would support the affirmative ideas expressed above. The best rebuttal to the neoliberal triumphalism mentioned above is a compelling collection of sociological studies grounded in the perspectives mentioned above. Michael Burawoy's sociology of factories is a good example (e.g. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226080382/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0226080382&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Manufacturing Consent: Changes in the Labor Process Under Monopoly Capitalism&lt;/a&gt;). But this isn't an approach that Boucher chooses to pursue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So what about it? Is Marxism relevant today? Yes, if we can avoid the dogmatism and rigidity that were often associated with the tradition. Power, exploitation, class, structures of production and distribution, property relations, workplace hierarchy -- these features certainly continue to be an important part of our social world. We need to think of Marx's corpus as a multiple source of hypotheses and interpretations about how capitalism works. And we need to recognize fully that no theoretical framework captures the whole of history or society. Marxism is not a comprehensive theory of social organization and change. But it does provide a useful set of hypotheses about how some of the key social mechanisms work in a class-divided society. Seen from that perspective, Marxist thought serves as a sort of proto-paradigm or mental framework in terms of which to pursue more specific social and historical investigations.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Understandingsociety/~4/IEfTtpHqqhY" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</content><link rel="replies" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/feeds/4058833712337310931/comments/default" title="Post Comments" /><link rel="replies" type="text/html" href="http://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-about-marx.html#comment-form" title="11 Comments" /><link rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4058766287077382431/posts/default/4058833712337310931?v=2" /><link rel="self" type="application/atom+xml" href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/4058766287077382431/posts/default/4058833712337310931?v=2" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Understandingsociety/~3/IEfTtpHqqhY/what-about-marx.html" title="What about Marx?" /><author><name>Daniel Little</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/105264573439237469924</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" width="32" height="32" src="//lh6.googleusercontent.com/--y4vBzEEeIo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/YOQ20no6wko/s512-c/photo.jpg" /></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fkoSQjKOU8I/UZVxVMeZJsI/AAAAAAAAH-U/G6nA6cU0Hu8/s72-c/kapital+stamp.jpg" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total>11</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-about-marx.html</feedburner:origLink></entry><entry gd:etag="W/&quot;DE4CRXg9eSp7ImA9WhBbF0k.&quot;"><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-4058766287077382431.post-4238015946041072376</id><published>2013-05-16T19:27:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2013-05-16T19:29:24.661-04:00</updated><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2013-05-16T19:29:24.661-04:00</app:edited><title>RFP: Research on "understanding"</title><content type="html">&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-yoMWtMakrL0/UZFjHuCxj7I/AAAAAAAAH9c/hnQQCUjKJxY/s640/blogger-image-2054119978.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-yoMWtMakrL0/UZFjHuCxj7I/AAAAAAAAH9c/hnQQCUjKJxY/s400/blogger-image-2054119978.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Numerous previous posts have emphasized the importance of having a theory of the actor when we do social science or history. Are people impulsive, emotional, envious, prudent, or moral -- or a mix of all of these things in different settings? We need to have some explicit and fact-based ideas about how and why people act as they do. This is not a new discovery for philosophers, and in fact much of the history of Western philosophy has wrestled with this question -- Aristotle, Augustine, Spinoza, Hume, Kant, and Hegel included.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Albert Hirschman is an important social theorist, generally classified as an economist, who often placed the varieties and sources of action at the center of his writings. (Here is an appreciation of Hirschman by Cass Sunstein in the &lt;i&gt;New York Review of Books&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/may/23/albert-hirschman-original-thinker/?pagination=false"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.) This interest in the actor is particularly evident in Hirschman's book,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691015988/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0691015988&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;The Passions and the Interests&lt;/a&gt; (1977) -- with an interesting twist. The book is a contribution to the history of ideas rather than contemporary social theory. Hirschman wants to know how the pursuit of personal gain came to be viewed as the central human virtue, the foundational assumption of much of the social sciences, and the foundation of the liberal ideal of society. And implicitly, he wants to know if we can arrive at a more adequate theory of the good society by reconsidering some of those assumptions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One way of characterizing Hirschman's leading intuition in this book is the question of whether different kinds of society reflect different mentalities at the level of the ordinary actors within them. Is there a "spirit" of capitalism, a characteristic set of motives and ways of thinking that its denizens possess? Is this spirit different from those associated with feudalism or the socioeconomic system of the ancient world? And how would various passions be linked to various features of the social order? Here is a revealing passage from Vico that Hirschman thinks captures much of this agenda:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Out of ferocity, avarice, and ambition, the three vices which lead all mankind astray, [society] makes national defense, commerce, and politics, and thereby causes the strength, the wealth, and the wisdom of the republics; out of these three great vices which would certainly destroy man on earth, society thus causes the civil happiness to emerge. This principle proves the existence of divine providence: through its intelligent laws the passions of men who are entirely occupied by the pursuit of their private utility are transformed into a civil order which permits men to live in human society. (kl 240)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
On this line of thought, we might say that greed and self-interest are the spirit of capitalism, honor is the spirit of feudalism, and power is the spirit of the ancient world. And it turns out that each of these ideas corresponds to a &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;passion&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;in traditional philosophy of action (greed for material wealth, quest for glory, thirst for power).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
The central problem, according to Hirschman, was how to control the passions in action. Some theorists came to believe that the only way to control the passions was through the workings of other passions. Here is Spinoza on this idea:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
An affect cannot be restrained nor removed unless by an opposed and stronger affect. (kl 294)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
So how have reflective people (philosophers, social theorists) thought about the springs of human action in different epochs? Hirschman's essay offers a careful history and review of one important strand of thinking about action, the extended debate that has existed over the nature and role of the passions in human action. He looks at this idea through a careful reading of thinkers like Augustine, Machiavelli, Spinoza, Montesquieu, the Duke of Rohan, and others. He tries to piece together the meaning that the ideas of passions and interests possessed in medieval and modern thought, how the concept of interest changed over time, and how the ideals concerning society and government were refracted as a consequence. Hirschman goes into exegetical detail about how a series of thinkers in the history of philosophy have thought about the virtues and passions, and how these were thought to contribute to various kinds of society. Here he makes the historical point linking ideas to social forms:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
With or without such sophisticated justification [as offered by St. Augustine], striving for honor and glory was exalted by the medieval chivalric ethos even though it stood at odds with the central teachings ... of a long line of religious writers, from St. Thomas Aquinas to Dante, who attacked glory-seeking as both vain and sinful. (kl 186)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is Hirschman's view that there was a very interesting evolution in thought about the passions during the early modern period. The heroic ideal was replaced by the idea that it is best for people to follow their own best interests. And this transition occurred, in part, through the swing towards positive science in the treatment of the world as expressed by Galileo and Hobbes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eventually self-interest came to be thought of as the antidote to arbitrary, capricious action based on more unruly passions. David Hume plays a central role in Hirschman's account. Hume advocated for restraining the "love of pleasure" by the "love of gain" (kl 321). And "Hume similarly uses the terms 'passion of interest' or the 'interested affection' as synonyms for the ' avidity of acquiring goods and possessions' or the 'love of gain'" (kl 424). (It is significant to recall that Hume and Adam Smith were neighbors and friends in the Scottish Enlightenment.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So the transition is more or less complete; the vice of avarice has become the virtue of the pursuit of self-interest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Once money-making wore the label of "interests" and reentered in this disguise the competition with other passions, it was suddenly acclaimed and even given the task of holding back those passions that had long been thought to be much less reprehensible. &amp;nbsp;(kl 459)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
It appears that the case for giving free rein and encouragement to private acquisitive pursuits was both the outcome of a long train of Western thought and an important ingredient of the intellectual climate of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. (kl 679)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The pursuit of gain (commerce) becomes the hidden hand that guides individual activities towards the collective good. And this idea does not originate with Adam Smith. Here is Montesquieu in the &lt;i&gt;Spirit of the Laws&lt;/i&gt; on the advantages of commerce as a foundation for society:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
The spirit of commerce brings with it the spirit of frugality, of economy, of moderation, of work, of wisdom, of tranquility, of order, and of regularity. In this manner, as long as this spirit prevails, the riches it creates do not have any bad effects. (kl 697)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And here is James Steuart about the advantages of a market society for the quality of government:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
The statesman looks about with amazement; he who was wont to consider himself as the first man in the society in every respect, perceives himself eclipsed by the lustre of private wealth, which avoids his grasp when he attempts to seize it. This makes his government more complex and more difficult to be carried on; he must now avail himself of art and address as well as of power and authority. (kl 793)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The advantages that this shift in the theory of the actor made possible, according to Hirschman, were predictability and constancy (kl 520). Theorists like Machiavelli, Hobbes, Hume, and Smith argued that a science of man was possible if we postulate that action derives from an assessment of self-interest. And that science is -- political economy. And the social ideal that corresponds to it is what Hegel and Marx referred to as "civil society", where individuals pursued their own interests in their own ways. It is a liberal market society where the maximum amount of social coordination occurs through market mechanisms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On this genealogy, interest started out as one of the three primary passions -- love of power, lust, and avarice. The passions were thought to produce bad behavior; so a recurring question was how to harness the passions in more socially constructive ways. And many thinkers came to the conclusion that only the passions themselves could serve to regulate the passions -- not pure reason. In particular, it was maintained that a strong regard for one's own interests could lead to self-regulation. But the most interesting part of the evolution of meanings is that interests came to be normatively favored, and they came to be understood to be distinct from the passions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We might call this the intellectual history of economic liberalism as a political ideology. And it is an ideology that Hirschman finds ultimately flawed. So did Tocqueville:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
A nation that demands from its government nothing but the maintenance of order is already a slave in the bottom of its heart; it is the slave of its well-being, and the man who is to chain it can arrive on the scene. (kl 1141)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
More generally, the anti-capitalist critiques associated with Marx, Durkheim, and the anarchists were powerful: the pure pursuit of gain has resulted in a society in which poverty, coercion, and anomie have become the lot of the majority of society.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is very interesting work in the history of ideas and ideology. And Hirschman engages in the work for a very serious reason: to try to discern some of the sources of the systemic flaws in modern market-based society. In this regard it is interesting to compare Hirschman's analysis of the development of the theory of the actor based on self-interest with C. B. Macpherson's analysis of the development of the theory of "possessive individualism". Here is a discussion of Macpherson's theory (&lt;a href="http://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2011/08/possessive-individualism.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(Here is Thomas Carlyle as anti-capitalist critic from the conservative side, on the topic of market society. He is contrasting the social order of aristocracy with the market order created by capitalism:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
It was [Aristocrats'] happiness that, in struggling for their own objects, they &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt; to govern the Lower Classes, even in this sense of governing. For, in one word, &lt;i&gt;Cash Payment&lt;/i&gt; had not then grown to be the universal sole nexus of man to man; it was something other than money that the high then expected from the low, and could not live without getting from the low. Not as buyer and seller alone, of land or what else it might be, but in many senses still as soldier and captain, as clansman and head, as loyal subject and guiding king, was the low related to the high. With the supreme triump of Cash, a changed time has entered; there must a changed Aristocracy enter. We invite the British reader to meditate earnestly on these things. (&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=RftQqOsf0oEC&amp;amp;pg=PP7&amp;amp;dq=thomas+carlyle+chartism"&gt;Chartism&lt;/a&gt;, 58)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Carlyle is anti-liberal in more senses than one; he is reactionary and hierarchical, and he is a fierce critic of the ideal of a cash-driven market society.)&lt;br /&gt;

So Elster's treatment of Tocqueville as a social scientist in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007NW801O/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B007NW801O&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Alexis de Tocqueville, the First Social Scientist&lt;/a&gt; will be of interest to anyone who wants to know how we have come to analyze societies in the terms we have. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Elster demonstrates a deep familiarity with Tocqueville's writings, though he focuses in this book on &lt;i&gt;L'Ancien regime&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Democracy in America&lt;/i&gt;. So Elster's Tocqueville is textually well supported. At the same time, Tocqueville is not really a theoretical writer. Instead, it is necessary to infer his theoretical ideas from the comments he makes about historical events and actors. So Elster is forced to engage in a fair amount of rational reconstruction of the theories that underlay a variety of Tocqueville's observations about the politics of France and America.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are several elements of Elster's interpretation of Tocqueville that seem particularly significant. One is Elster's view that Tocqueville operated on the basis of a conception of social explanation that depended on social mechanisms rather than general laws. Elster believes that the most important feature of Tocqueville's claim to being a sociologist is his consistent search for causes. The other key to Elster's analysis of Tocqueville is his focus on features of the actor -- reason, interests, and passions, or what Tocqueville refers to as "habits of the heart".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Among the social mechanisms that Elster focuses on are those that surround preference formation. This question is plainly key to having a theory of political psychology: why do people make the choices that they do? He singles out three distinct psychological mechanisms that Tocqueville alludes to: the spillover effect, the compensation effect, and the satiation effect (kl 292). Preference formation is a topic that has consistently interested Elster, and he spends much time on the question in his early writings, including the formal question of time preferences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What is "enlightened self-interest"? Elster finds that Tocqueville contrasts "egoism" with "enlightened self-interest" as well as with altruism. Egoism means an exclusive attention to one's own interests in the moment. So it is opposed both to altruism (concern for the interests of others) and foresight (concern for one's future interests) (kl 1113). (This bears out Amartya Sen's comment in "Rational Fools" that the purely economic man is indeed close to being a social moron; &lt;a href="http://understandingsociety.blogspot.fr/2012/03/amartya-sens-commitments.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Elster is particularly interested in Tocqueville's treatment of the passions. He specifically discusses Envy, Fear, Hatred , Enthusiasm, Contempt, and Shame as emotions (passions) that often drive behavior in opposition to both interests and reason. This brings his discussion into intersection with that of Albert Hirschman in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691015988/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0691015988&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;The Passions and the Interests&lt;/a&gt;. (The Kindle edition includes a very interesting introduction by Amartya Sen; &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00307RX1O/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00307RX1O&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.) Hirschman's book looks at the ways that early political economists and philosophers such as Smith and Hume thought about the relationships among reason, passion, and interest, with a view toward the generally moderating effects of interests on behavior in many historical settings. Elster finds a very similar line of thought in Tocqueville. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Elster addresses the topic of the micro-macro relationship in the conclusion. He finds that Tocqueville is interested in both directions of influence -- from micro to macro and from macro to micro. He provides a diagram that looks a lot like an inverted version of Coleman's boat:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LZDGytGH6RE/UYuwyXk6ofI/AAAAAAAAH84/u7RZohb2-B8/s640/blogger-image--1548007910.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LZDGytGH6RE/UYuwyXk6ofI/AAAAAAAAH84/u7RZohb2-B8/s400/blogger-image--1548007910.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Elster doesn't put his views in these terms, but much of what he has to say about Tocqueville can be put in the category of piecing together Tocqueville's &lt;i&gt;theory of the actor&lt;/i&gt;: why people behave as they do. His discussions of preferences, individualism, norms, and passions all fall in the domain of a theory of the actor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Elster's treatment of Tocqueville is of interest in part because of its direct relevance to the explication of Tocqueville's thought. But I find it more interesting for what it shows about Elster's own thinking about sociological investigation. It is plain that Elster favors an actor-centered sociology. In some writings he explicitly describes his view as methodological individualism. Here the approach is somewhat more tolerant of schemes of explanation that are not directly reductionist. But it is focused on the varieties and sources of human action, and the ways that these features of action compound into unexpected social outcomes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(Here is an earlier post where I discussed Tocqueville's status as a founding sociologist; &lt;a href="http://understandingsociety.blogspot.fr/2008/01/was-alexis-de-tocqueville-social.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I recently spent a half day visiting Detroit with some very perceptive university colleagues. We visited the university's center on Woodward Avenue, the Riverfront Conservancy, and the Madison Building -- all places where exciting signs of change are underway. Along the way we heard a lot of enthusiasm about the progress Detroit is making: more professional jobs downtown, residential and commercial real estate at 95%+ occupancy, entrepreneurial companies, $75 million invested in a spectacular river walk along the Detroit River, some very talented high school students coming out of several of Detroit's best high schools.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The most common reaction in the group to what we saw was a positive one. Detroit is better off than the media portrays it. There are powerful processes of renewal underway that will change the future of the city for all its inhabitants for the better. The reinfusion of businesses and middle-class residents will improve the tax base and the city's fiscal sustainability. And somehow these benefits will trickle out to the neighborhoods.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Or not. Like others, several of us noticed that these developments in downtown Detroit (Campus Martius, the Woodward Corridor) have had very little effect on the neighborhoods where 80-90% of the city lives. The sports, arts, and dining destinations are great -- but they don't have much to do with Detroit's blighted neighborhoods. Unemployed high school dropouts aren't going to be offered jobs in the high tech startups.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So what is the future for the impoverished and undereducated youth of this city? The theory I was testing in my mind was Loic Wacqant's concept in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0745631258/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0745631258&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Urban Outcasts: A Comparative Sociology of Advanced Marginality&lt;/a&gt; of fundamental marginalization--a sub-population of people with no avenues of opportunity and no hope for the future (&lt;a href="http://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2013/04/urban-marginality.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). This view implies that the segregated urban enclaves of American cities like Chicago, Washington, or Detroit offer virtually no prospect of social mobility for the young men and women who grow up there. Is that too bleak? Does it overlook or underestimate pathways of mobility that can bring substantial improvement for life expectations for this community after all? Or is permanent impacted poverty and disaffection the more likely outcome?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I talked with two other participants in this visit who disagreed with the "permanent marginalization" view in interesting ways. Both of these people were African-American men who had grown up in metro Detroit. One, born in 1970, took issue with the youth-hopelessness part of the picture. His view is that Detroit is significantly different from Chicago (the city Wacquant studied most closely), because Detroit is a majority black city. So he thinks teenagers in Detroit have an optimism their counterparts in Chicago lack. He also thinks the lower residential density of Detroit is an advantage. Young people are less oppressed by racism because they are part of a population that governs the city. By contrast, he argues that the black population of Chicago looks at the city as a white city and they feel powerless. So urban despair is deeper in Chicago.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The other person in the conversation had what is in someways a view even bleaker than mine. He is a distinguished social scientist born in 1940. He too grew up in the Detroit metro area. He commented that the developers' vision is really a picture of a white city. "This is a white vision of Detroit's future." He predicted that in 25 years the black population of Detroit will be largely gone, replaced by a more affluent white population. Wow!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One thing that came out of the evening is an intriguing idea: invite a group of Detroit 18-year-olds, some in high school and some dropouts, to have a conversation about the future of their neighborhoods and their city, and what they think about their own futures. These are the kinds of conversations Al Young reports in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/069112700X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=069112700X&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;The Minds of Marginalized Black Men: Making Sense of Mobility, Opportunity, and Future Life Chances&lt;/a&gt;. This would shed some light on all the major theories of urban futures. And conversations like these would be an important reality check for people who think that there is a general process of improvement that is going to bring everyone up through some kind of hidden-hand process of market successes. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The "permanent marginalization" view is a dark one, but it is not passive. Rather, it undergirds the idea that the structures of race and segregation still present in our society have embodied enduring and intractable inequalities, and only deliberate, sustained, and committed efforts will allow us to resolve these problems. Our cities need structural change and substantial public investment, deliberately aimed at breaking the circles of poverty, race, inferior education, and disaffection, and sustained over decades rather than years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The developments we looked at during our visit are certainly important steps forward for the city. And the business leaders who are stimulating these developments are committed to improving Detroit's future. But I'm not yet convinced that these developments can lead by themselves to the transformation of the lives of the whole population of the city, black and white, without other initiatives that are directly aimed at breaking down the barriers of race and poverty that imprison so many of Detroit's young people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
("Imprison" is probably the right word in this context, given the epidemic of incarceration our cities have witnessed in the past thirty years.

Watch an active construction site for a few minutes and you will see some amazing examples of skilled work and deft problem solving. That was true today in Ann Arbor where I happened to see one complicated step in the construction of a new wing of a five-storey building. The problem was this. A fifty-foot girder was lifted by crane to its intended location within the vertical steel frame. Already I was impressed with the skill of the crane operator, who deftly maneuvered the beam into position where two steel workers were waiting on the existing beam. The crane suspended the beam in place and the steel workers bolted the near end to the frame. So far so good. But the far end was to attach to an isolated vertical beam fifty feet away, and I couldn't picture how that end would be attached. The steel worker answered that question quickly. He scuttled the length of the beam to the isolated vertical while the beam was suspended by the crane cable and the attached end. But now the resistance of the material world intervened -- the beam was a little too long to fit. The worker used two crow bars he'd brought with him to lever it into place -- no good. It was just half an inch too long given the position of the vertical. So are we stymied? Need to send it back? No. The worker stood up on the beam and started gently rocking the vertical. After two or three oscillations he was able to lever the beam into place, and quickly bolted it down.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's not a completely amazing instance of problem solving on the job, but it is impressive nonetheless. Certainly the users' manual doesn't have a section on what to do in this circumstance. But given his prior training, experience, and embodied skills, the worker was able to come up with a solution that worked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Richard Sennett describes this kind of artisanal intelligence in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300151195/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0300151195&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;The Craftsman&lt;/a&gt;. He describes craftsmanship as "the skill of making things well" (8). Further,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Craftsman&lt;/i&gt; explores these dimensions of skill, commitment, and judgment in a particular way. It focuses on the intimate connection between hand and head. Every good craftsman conducts a dialogue between concrete practices and thinking; this dialogue evolves into sustaining habits, and these habits establish a rhythm between problem solving and problem finding. The relation between hand and head appears in domains seemingly as different as bricklaying, cooking, designing a playground, or playing the cello— but all these practices can misfire or fail to ripen. (9)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A part of the interest of Sennett's work here is the help it provides in redressing the idea that mental work is professional and cognitive, while manual work is repetitive and rote. Sennett gives many contemporary examples of work that is both head and hand, both cognitive and skilled, both creative and manual. Sennett gives many examples of this kind of artisanal intelligence. Here is one from the construction of a large shopping mall in Atlanta. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The lighting in these aboveground car-houses turned out to be uneven in intensity, dangerous shadows suddenly appearing within the building. Painters had added odd-shaped white strip lines to guide drivers in and out of irregular pools of light, showing signs of improvising rather than following the plan. The craftsmen had done further, deeper thinking about light than the designers. (44-45)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sennett's point here is that the implementation of a complex space is not simply the translation of a computer-generated architectural drawing into material form. Rather, it is a process that requires real workers to find solutions to the inevitable fact of gaps and inconsistencies in the plan--in this case, the fact that the lighting didn't fully illuminate the space, leading to risks for pedestrians and drivers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A dominant tradition of philosophy identifies our human essence with our ability to think and reason. Descartes represents this line of thought ("cogito ergo sum").  But there is another tradition that places labor and our capacity to transform the material world at the center of the human essence. Hegel represented this line of thought, as did Marx. It is the &lt;i&gt;homo faber&lt;/i&gt; tradition -- man the creator -- and all in all, it seems to do a better job of defining us. Labor and skilled intelligence lie at the core of human capacities. And that is a good thing to remember on May 1, the international day celebrating labor.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0WCpqxl_IAM/UX8apUMulWI/AAAAAAAAH6g/07mk20sO2Yk/s1600/china-poor-rural-girl-03-pulling-cart.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0WCpqxl_IAM/UX8apUMulWI/AAAAAAAAH6g/07mk20sO2Yk/s320/china-poor-rural-girl-03-pulling-cart.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Periods of rapid structural change are particularly likely to lead to decline in the quality of life of some sections of the affected population. Change creates winners and losers; and it is common that the gains and losses are channeled into very distinct groups of people. &amp;nbsp;This is true during periods of large-scale migration, technology change, and structural change within an economy. Important components of life quality include health, nutrition, education, economic wellbeing, economic security, and security from violence and coercion. Each of these properties is affected by several important dimensions of social life:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;legal and political institutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;institutions of economic production and distribution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;economic opportunities and income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;public provision of income supplements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;public provision of food subsidies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;public provision of health care resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;household support provided by family and community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
When a society's governmental and economic institutions are enmeshed in a period of rapid change, many of the components of life quality are likely to be affected -- positively or negatively. The basic institutions of a society determine the value of the private and public assets individuals and households control on the basis of which to support their pursuit of a decent life; this is what Amartya Sen refers to as "entitlement bundles". (Sen applies his entitlement theory to the study of famine in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0198284632/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0198284632&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~dludden/FamineMortality.pdf"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.) And shifts in the composition of the entitlement bundle are likely to lead to abrupt worsening of the conditions of the least-well-off.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For example: It is likely that the austerity policies of the Spanish or Greek governments will have a negative effect on the health and nutritional status of the bottom half of those societies. Working people will have lower incomes and they will have reduced access to the social safety net; health status is likely to decline. As another example: Life expectancy in the former Soviet Union declined measurably following the collapse of the Soviet system (&lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2955420"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). One part of that decline was the disappearance of the social security net created by state-owned industry -- the smashing of the "iron rice bowl".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This concern is particularly relevant in the context of the rural-urban transformation currently underway in China.&amp;nbsp;Since 1980 China's rural sector has been subject to at least two major kinds of structural change. One has to do with the economic and political institutions that governed daily life for rural households, from communes to market institutions. And the other has to do with the rapid structural transformation of China's economy from agriculture to export-led manufacturing. The first set of changes led to a withdrawal of forms of "social insurance" that had been associated with the commune system, including healthcare and old-age care. The second has led to mass migration of younger workers from villages and towns to factories in cities. This migration leaves the remaining population in the countryside older, poorer, and less economically secure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These observations have several important implications. Foremost among these is the crucial importance of maintaining effective systems for monitoring and measuring life quality across the society. It is important to have good measures of health status, nutritional status, educational status, and old age life quality across regions and sub-populations. So national governments need to create and fund the social research activities necessary to measure health and other quality of life properties across the population. (Here is a recent post on a spatial study of quality of life in China based on 1982 data; &lt;a href="http://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2012/09/quality-of-life-in-china.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.) Sen argues that it was the availability or lack of availability of information about famine conditions that explained the difference in outcomes between China during the Great Leap Forward and post-independence India;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0198284632/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0198284632&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Second, when it turns out that there are large numbers of "losers" in a large social process of change, it is important for the state and non-governmental actors to find institutions and resources that will help to improve their outcomes. "Winners" need to help to fund the amelioration of harms created by the processes that led to their gains. If NAFTA led to the increase of overall national income for Canada, Mexico, and the United States, but also led to the displacement of workers in a significant set of industries -- then it makes sense to tax part of those gains to compensate the losers. And in fact, the NAFTA agreements were premised on such compensation, though this has not occurred reliably (&lt;a href="http://www.epi.org/publication/briefingpapers_nafta01_index/"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). This means redistribution across sectors and regions; and it is justified by the fact that the overall gains created by the transformation would not have been possible without imposing these losses on the disadvantaged sector or region.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What might this kind of redistributive policy look like in the context of China's rural-to-urban transformation? It would seem that public moneys will be needed for several types of problems:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintenance of income and quality of life and health for the elderly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investments that increase the productivity of labor and the level of employment in rural areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investments that work to ameliorate the negative environmental effects of rapid change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investments in the institutions of public health -- clinics, hospitals, and medical personnel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
It might be asked, "Why should developing nations concern themselves with this issue?" There are several answers. Basic justice and fairness entails that the wealth of a society should be distributed in ways that allow all segments of society to improve their quality of life and wellbeing. A society's wealth and income is a joint product of its entire population; so fairness dictates that everyone should benefit from improvements in productivity. But prudence lines up with this answer as well. A society that ignores the widening of the gaps between rich and poor, and does not concern itself about improving the wellbeing of the poor, is likely to suffer a rising level of social strife as well. It can either go the route of creating gated communities for the rich, or it can use its resources to create fair life outcomes and fair access to opportunity for all its people. Everyone is better off in the long run with the second choice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0813316421/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0813316421&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;The Paradox Of Wealth And Poverty: Mapping The Ethical Dilemmas Of Global Development&lt;/a&gt; I argued that a developing nation should choose an economic development strategy that spreads the benefits of growth over a broader population, over a strategy with a higher growth rate but with substantially greater inequality. I still think this is the right answer to the question. And this approach has the best likelihood of improving the quality of life of the poorest segment of society. The graphs below make the case based on three stylized strategies:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NL   &lt;b&gt;neo-liberal growth&lt;/b&gt;: choose those policies and institutional reforms that lead to the most rapid growth: unfettered markets, profit-maximizing firms, minimal redistribution of in­come and wealth&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PF    &lt;b&gt;poverty-first growth&lt;/b&gt;: choose those policies and institutional reforms that lead to economic growth favorable to the most rapid growth in the incomes flowing to the poorest 2 quintiles&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WF  &lt;b&gt;immediate welfare improvement&lt;/b&gt;: direct as much social wealth as possible into programs that immediately improve the welfare of the poor (education, health, food subsidies, housing subsidies)&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The neo-liberal strategy consistently maximizes GDP; but the poverty-first strategy, which is more redistributive from the start, leads to consistently better improvement for the income for the bottom 40% of the economy. &amp;nbsp;It embodies the idea that Hollis Chenery advocated forty years ago in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199200696/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0199200696&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Redistribution with Growth: Policies to Improve Income Distribution in Developing Countries in the Context of Economic Growth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BPwTduCH0qQ/UXh4mQ60wUI/AAAAAAAAH6Q/hzyXrMckVZE/s1600/London-Riot-6.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="203" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BPwTduCH0qQ/UXh4mQ60wUI/AAAAAAAAH6Q/hzyXrMckVZE/s320/London-Riot-6.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you live within the reach of a major American city -- and most Americans do -- then you know what "marginality" is. It is the sizable sub-population of metropolitan America of young men and women who have been locked out of what we think of as the indispensable mechanisms of social mobility: decent education, healthcare resources, job opportunities, and safe neighborhoods. It is the young people of inner-city Baltimore depicted by &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt;.  (Take a look at Richard Florida's detailed analysis of the spatial class structure of Detroit and a number of other cities; &lt;a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/neighborhoods/2013/04/class-divided-cities-detroit-edition/4679/"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.) The facts of compacted poverty and lack of opportunity, and the disaffection of young people that goes along with these absences, represent one of the most pressing social problems we face. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How should we go about studying and changing this appalling social reality? Alford Young's &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/069112700X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=069112700X&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;The Minds of Marginalized Black Men: Making Sense of Mobility, Opportunity, and Future Life Chances&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is one striking approach, using extended interviews to gain insight into the minds, worldviews, and social realities of some of these young people. (Here is an earlier discussion of Young's work; &lt;a href="http://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2012/07/thinking-poverty-in-inner-city.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.)  Another approach is the large body of mainstream poverty research in the social sciences and policy studies. (Here is a penetrating critique of some of the assumptions of this research by Alice O'Connor; &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0691102554/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0691102554&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Poverty Knowledge: Social Science, Social Policy, and the Poor in Twentieth-Century U.S. History&lt;/a&gt;.) But an important and original voice on these issues is that of Loïc Wacquant, and particularly important is &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0745631258/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0745631258&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Urban Outcasts: A Comparative Sociology of Advanced Marginality&lt;/a&gt; (2008).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wacquant's Ph.D. work was done at the University of Chicago (like Young's), and he too immersed himself in the street-level realities of segregated, impoverished Chicago. Wacquant's approach was a novel one: he took up boxing in an inner city boxing club to gain access to the ordinary lives of the young men of the neighborhoods. His ethnography of this experience was published in the fascinating book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195305620/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0195305620&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Body and Soul: Notebooks of an Apprentice Boxer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wacquant is French and comparativist; he is interested in investigating the experience of marginality in the United States and comparing it with equally marginalized neighborhoods in France, the &lt;em&gt;banlieue&lt;/em&gt; of Paris. (Here is an earlier &lt;a href="http://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2008/11/segregation-in-france.html"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;em&gt;banlieue&lt;/em&gt; and the sociological research of Didier Lapeyronnie's&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/2221107667/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=2221107667&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Ghetto urbain; ségrégation, violence, pauvreté en France aujourd'hui&lt;/a&gt;.) In each instance modern cities are found to have large populations of apparently permanently marginalized under-class people. Here is how Wacquant frames the issue in "The Rise of Advanced Marginality: Notes on its Nature and Implications" (&lt;a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4194814"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;) (1996):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
The resurgence of extreme poverty and destitution, ethnoracial divisions (linked to the colonial past) and public violence, and their accumulation in the same distressed urban areas, suggest that the metropolis is the site and fount of novel forms of exclusionary social closure in advanced societies. (121)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
But Wacquant's summary finding is perhaps a surprising one: he finds that the "Black Belt" in Chicago and the "Red Belt" of Paris are substantially different social phenomena. Rather than a homogeneous social reality of "ghetto" extending from Chicago to London to Amsterdam to Paris, he finds a differentiated social reality:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
A paired comparison between neighborhoods of relegation in Chicago's 'Black Belt' and the Parisian 'Red Belt' shows that the declining French metropolitan periphery and the Afro-American ghetto remain two sharply distinct sociospatial constellations. And for good reason: they are heirs to different urban legacies, produced by different logics of segregation and aggregation, and inserted in different welfare state and market frameworks, all of which result in markedly higher levels of blight, segregation, isolation, and distress in the US ghetto. (122)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Wacquant introduces the idea of "advanced marginality" to describe the social reality of isolation and deprivation created by advanced capitalism in the rich cities of the North. Here are the criteria he offers for a social system embedding advanced marginality:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the growing internal heterogeneity and desocialization of labor,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the functional disconnection of neighborhood conditions from macro-economic trends;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;territorial fixation and stigmatization; spatial alienation and the dissolution of place;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the loss of a viable hinterland; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the symbolic fragmentation of marginalized population (121)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
An element that Wacquant finds to be in common across advanced marginality in modern cities is what he calls "territorial fixation" -- the confinement of the marginal in specific neighborhoods of the city.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Rather than being diffused throughout working class areas, advanced marginality tends to concentrate in well-identified, bounded, and increasingly isolated territories viewed by both outsiders and insiders as social purgatories, urban hellholes where only the refuse of society would accept to dwell. (125)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0745631258/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0745631258&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=danlithompag-20"&gt;Urban Outcasts&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Wacquant provides a much more developed comparative sociology of marginalized urban populations. It is significant that he begins his treatment of marginality with the topic of riot and uprising -- a recurring social reality in the United States (Chicago, Watts, Detroit, ...), London, Strasbourg, and Paris. This seems significant, because it seems like a logical correlate with the deprivation and stigmatization associated with advanced marginality.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Most of the disorders, big and small, that have shaken up the French working-class banlieues, the British inner city and adjacent barrios of North American have involved chiefly the youths of impoverished, segregated and often dilapidated urban neighbourhoods caught in a spiral of decline; they appear to have been fuelled by growing ethnoracial tensions in and around those areas. (20)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And Wacquant thinks these uprisings stem from three large social causes: mass unemployment, relegation to decaying neighbourhoods, and heightened stigmatization in daily life of the marginalized young people (25). He quotes a young man from Bristol:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
I don't have a job and I'll never have one. Nobody wants to help us get out of this shit. If the government can spend so much money to build a nuclear submarine, why not for the inner cities? If fighting cops is the only way to get heard, then we'll fight them. (31)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is a superb piece of sociology, making use of multiple means of inquiry (ethnographic, comparison, statistical) to arrive at credible theories of the causes of urban marginality. And, contrary to the critique offered by O'Connor of mainstream poverty studies, there is not an ounce of "blaming the poor" in this study. Wacquant wants to understand the social processes that create and reproduce the urban spatial reality of marginality. And in doing this, he aims to provide some of the understanding we will need to begin to take this system apart.&lt;br /&gt;
