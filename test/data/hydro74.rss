Maybe to the viewer, it&#8217;s not that exciting, but to me, it&#8217;s a way to do whatever I want and have limited creative feedback to develop something I think is fitting for a event.  Simply put, I love it.   I&#8217;ve been really busy on many other things as well and also trying to get the new site design sorted in every small bit of free-time I&#8217;ve been able to grab.  So just a heads up, something rad is coming soon:)</span></p>

<p><span class="color">Few weeks back, Back in Black 2 hit Ybor Florida with great success.  Over 950 people attended the event that night with another 350 hitting the after party.  It personally took me a week to recover from this event, then found myself neck deep in client work.  All in all, everything was fantastic.  <a href="http://www.palehorsedesign.com">Pale Horse</a> did so much on the back end with prepping, setting up and keeping things in order that a special thanks goes to them.  Revolt Marketing came in and developed a great party with Dave Nada, Monk and some residence DJ&#8217;s.  One highlight was having ISO50 do his set at the closing of the show.  Of course, by that time, I was fueled by too many free drinks, A.D.D and keeping up with everyone else.  However from what I did catch, pretty amazing.</span></p>
<p><span class="color">If you didn&#8217;t get a chance to check it out already, hit up <a href="http://www.backinblackapparel.com">Back in Black</a> for a recap.  Shirts are no longer available, however I know Back in Black 3 is already getting some whispers.  Thank you to all who attended, ordered and just supported both Chris from Pale Horse &#038; I as we just put together a show we felt very passionate about.</span></p>

It&#8217;s not every day you can do as you wish on piece and develop something that will be given away at various events as well as having your name attached to it. Over this past month I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to develop posters for Steve Aoki, Peaches, Chimaira, Le Castle Vania, Dave Nada, Cut Copy, The Presets, &#038; a few others.  I am pretty stoked to see these go from digital ideas to silk screened pieces.</span></p>
