<description><p>Israel says ketchup isn't ketchup anymore, and we need to start growing more indigenous crops. Check out what the Internet taught us this week.</p>

<content:encoded><div><img src="http://modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/turkey-bacon-recall-roundup.jpg"/></div><h4><br>Take a <i>Modern Farmer</i>-approved trip around the web with the stories that got us talking this week. Bus leaves every Friday, so join any time.</h4><p>Earlier this week, FoodTank schooled us on how indigenous crops are <a href="http://foodtank.com/news/2015/08/indigenous-crops-promoting-health-feeding-world" target="_blank">sustainable</a> and good for the environment. Guess we need to find some hinkelhatz pepper seeds to grow in our gardens.</p>
<p>Over in California, the drought isn’t just drying up land, it’s drying up the <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/08/27/434763709/farmworkers-see-jobs-earnings-shrivel-in-california-drought" target="_blank">jobs</a> as well, reports NPR. More than 21,000 farmworkers are out of work, and the ones who do work are making less money.</p>
<p>Syngenta put <a href="http://www.farms.com/ag-industry-news/monsanto-ends-pursuit-of-syngenta-after-bid-rejected-391.aspx" target="_blank">the kibosh</a> on its close-but-no-cigar merger with Monsanto, declaring that Monsanto’s $46.2 billion offer didn&#8217;t cut it.</p>
<p>FoodBeast shared how Israel&#8217;s Health Ministry decided that Heinz ketchup wasn&#8217;t <a href="http://www.foodbeast.com/news/israel-heinz/" target="_blank">tomato-y enough</a>. The Ministry&#8217;s requires 10 percent tomato paste, and Heinz comes in at 6 percent. Until requirements change, Heinz&#8217;s Hebrew label will read as &#8220;tomato seasoning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lastly, Kraft recalled a bunch of turkey bacon on Tuesday due to <a href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/recall-case-archive/archive/2015/recall-113-2015-release" target="_blank">possible adulteration</a>, which is weird because we always thought that turkey bacon was faithful. Was Ashley Madison involved? Oh, wait. This just means that the bacon may spoil before its &#8220;best when used by date.&#8221;</p>

<content:encoded><div><img src="http://modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/rsz_gdf_069.jpg"/></div><h4><br>Meet <a href="http://www.greendirtfarm.com" target="_blank">Green Dirt Farm</a>, a sheep dairy farm and creamery in Weston, Missouri. They’re taking over <a href="https://instagram.com/modfarm/" target="_blank">Modern Farmer's Instagram account</a> for a bit. Stop by and have a look!</h4><div class='ctx-sidebar-container' id='contextly-pAWj8fCsPR8xTOkycanUKbvjXOlcqTFs'></div>
<p>When Sarah Hoffmann gave up her medical career, she wanted her children to have the opportunity to experience farm life. It was the same type of opportunity she had growing up, even though her father was a career Navy man. While the family moved around a lot, they always settled onto small farms rather than military bases, instilling in Sarah a love for farm life.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hoffman, 56, originally intended to grow vegetables, but discovered the initial 25 acres she had purchased were better suited for </span><a href="http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/mo/newsroom/stories/?cid=nrcs144p2_012903" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grazing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She instead turned to raising sheep, and along with sheep came a new-found passion for cheesemaking.</span></p>
<p>Located about 40 miles northwest of Kansas City, Hoffman raises her 70-ewe milking flock on 150 acres, plus land her neighbors allow her animals to graze on. It’s a win-win situation, since they get free lawn care, thanks to Hoffman’s hungry sheep.</p>
<p>The farm produces award-winning sheep-milk cheese, yogurt, and grass-fed lamb. They’re also known for the farm dinners featuring local chefs ​they host on a regular basis.</p>
<div id="attachment_39171" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/rsz_gdf_040.jpg"><img class="wp-image-39171 size-full" src="http://modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/rsz_gdf_040.jpg" alt="rsz_gdf_040" width="800" height="533"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Sarah Farrar</em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hoffman and her former business partner, Jacqueline Smith, started Green Dirt Farm in 2000. They began selling grass-fed lamb two years later and started producing cheese in 2008. Smith has since left the farm after launching </span><a href="http://www.kansascity.com/living/food-drink/article28847878.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central Grazing Co.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which supplies locally raised, grass-fed lamb to restaurants and grocery stores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green Dirt is a sustainable farm and grade-A dairy that&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://animalwelfareapproved.org/" target="_blank">Animal Welfare Approved</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">meaning they’ve passed a rigorous process proving they raise their animals humanely and operate with the environment in mind. </span></p>
<p>“Our motto is, ‘dirt, grass, sheep, milk, cheese, community,’” says ​Rachel Kleine, a cheesemaker at the farm. “To us, this means that the details that seem to be only of minor importance to our cheese making craft—for example, our attention to the care of our soil—are, in fact, of supreme significance in creating our products.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kleine, 26, says elevating small details serves to remind them of their “dependence on the land, the animals, and each other. We believe that happy sheep produce great milk, so we take great pride in the care and well-being of our animals.”</span></p>

<content:encoded><div><img src="http://modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/rsz_shutterstock_140335270.jpg"/></div><h4><br>You get your ground beef in a nice little cellophane package, and your pork chops wrapped in white paper by a butcher. But have you ever thought about what happens to the rest of the animal, the parts that aren’t sizzling on your grill or baking in the oven?</h4><div class='ctx-sidebar-container' id='contextly-9cpKIWxPQmqibHfU0YDg4dz0zLngWgmX'></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a lot of waste that comes from the slaughter of livestock. Forty percent of the animal gets turned into the recognizable cuts you find at the store, while 60 percent of the animal (besides the stuff that goes into </span><a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/whats-in-your-wiener-hot-dog-ingredients-explained/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hot dogs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)—things like bones, blood, connective tissue and other various parts—needs to be either recycled or tossed out, according to </span><em><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2010/08/the-deadstock-dilemma-our-toxic-meat-waste/61191/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Atlantic</span></a></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Here are some ways people are taking those leftovers and turning them into something useful.</span></p>
<h2 class="mf-h2 mf-heading-align-left">Something to Wear</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers at the </span><a href="https://www.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2015/07/yarn-from-slaughterhouse-waste.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swiss Federal Institute of Technology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Zurich have developed yarn comparable to Merino wool that uses slaughterhouse waste as the base for the material, specifically the collagen from skin, bone, and tendons. The fiber’s creators hope it may one day compete with petroleum-based synthetic fiber. Nearly </span><a href="http://www.apic2014.com/download/SF%204%20-APIC2014_Global%20Fibers%20Overview.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">56 million metric tons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of synthetic fiber was produced in 2013 alone, and the manufacture of that material (polyester, rayon, spandex, and others) is an energy-intensive </span><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1964887/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This new (non-vegetarian?) fiber designed by Philipp Stössel, a 28-year-old PhD student at the institute, is still in the testing stage and isn’t yet commercially available.</span></p>
<h2 class="mf-h2 mf-heading-align-left">Something to Run On</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of turning slaughterhouse waste into biofuel has been around for awhile, but there are some newer innovations worth a look. </span><a href="http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/newsreleases/2014/march/new-way-to-make-biodiesel-creates-less-waste-from-alligator-and-likely-other-animal-fats.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette have developed a faster and less wasteful way to convert alligator fat into biofuel. Alligator farming has been growing rapidly across the Southeastern United States, and with that comes a lot of waste—15 million pounds per year, according to </span><em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/business/energy-environment/researchers-study-producing-biodiesel-from-alligators.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></a></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The new technique uses a </span><a href="http://www.essentialchemicalindustry.org/processes/chemical-reactors.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continuous reactor </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">instead of a batch reactor, speeding up processing, and doesn’t require a catalyst, which leads to less waste. The researchers are looking into whether other animal fats, such as chicken, pork, and beef, can be converted to biofuel through the same method.</span></p>
<h2 class="mf-h2 mf-heading-align-left">Something to Grow On</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Kenya, a community-based slaughterhouse in Kiserian, just outside of Nairobi, is bottling </span><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/11/us-kenya-biogas-idUSKBN0KK06U20150111"><span style="font-weight: 400;">biogas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made from its waste, which it plans to sell to consumers at about half the cost of  traditional liquid petroleum gas. The facility is also converting waste material into a </span><a href="http://www.rtcc.org/2015/04/27/slaughterhouse-helps-herders-survive-climate-change/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fertilizer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Maasai herdsmen in the hopes of creating faster-growing grass for their grazing cattle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some who </span><a href="http://www.treehugger.com/renewable-energy/beef-fat-turned-into-fuel-at-new-calgary-biodiesel-plant.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">argue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> meat production is a </span><a href="http://modernfarmer.com/2015/08/meat-waste-is-worse-for-the-environment-than-vegetable-waste/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">carbon-intensive process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and merely reusing the byproducts of turning a cow into a steak isn’t really solving the problem. But slaughterhouses aren’t going away anytime soon. (In fact, meat consumption continues to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.farmecon.com/Documents/Projections%20of%20Global%20Meat%20Production%20Through%202050.pdf" target="_blank">ramp up</a> in a big way.) S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o it&#8217;s encouraging that some waste is being reused; but it’s also a reminder that perhaps having a salad instead of a steak every so often isn’t a bad idea.</span></p>

</description>
<content:encoded><div><img src="http://modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gulfshrimp.jpeg"/></div><h4><br>Shrimp is one of America's favorite seafood, but a whopping 90 percent of our supply comes from overseas, largely from farms prone to disease and environmental destruction. And that leaves domestic shrimp producers in the lurch, as prices plummet dangerously.</h4><div class='ctx-sidebar-container' id='contextly-3VL0kTBm3nVh6rXLf4HsKi4ipbgchcWw'></div>
<p>Most of our shrimp is imported from farms in Thailand, China, the Philippines, Ecuador, and Brazil, among other countries. These have varying levels of acceptability; a handful use very responsible recirculating systems, but the vast majority are spectacularly gross. Organic waste, antibiotics, and various chemicals (largely and ironically for sanitary purposes) leach into the groundwater and pollute the nearby waterways. Escapees from the farms also breed, forcing out native species and screwing with the local ecosystems. <a href="http://modernfarmer.com/2015/08/costco-slave-farmed-shrimp/">Costco is even currently embroiled in a scandal</a> for selling Thai shrimp that&#8217;s produced, in part, with slave labor. There&#8217;s no end of reasons to be wary of cheap imports.</p>
<p>Yet international farming remains the most popular choice to supply our demand, despite that in the Gulf of Mexico we have our own historic, high-quality shrimp industry. In Louisiana and Texas, shrimpers have been pulling in world-class white, brown, and pink crustaceans for generations. Soon enough, that might end. Year over year, prices have dropped an absurd amount; Louisiana shrimpers <a href="http://theadvocate.com/news/13162006-123/shrimpers-rally-in-new-orleans" target="_blank">told <em>The Advocate</em></a> that their at-dock prices dropped from about $4.70 per pound last year to $1.30 this year. <a href="http://www.wwltv.com/story/news/local/orleans/2015/08/12/permits-shrimp-louisiana/31568557/" target="_blank">This summer, right up to this week</a>, domestic shrimpers have begun protesting at a higher pitch, demanding stricter regulations, presumably in the form of tariffs, to protect domestic shrimp and block the imported stuff.</p>
<p>Despite the slightly higher price for domestic wild shrimp, they are better for consumers, at least those who care about the planet. The Monterey Bay Aquarium&#8217;s Seafood Watch, the largest seafood watchdog group in the country, rates domestic shrimp as near-universally superior in sustainability to imported, and fishmongers <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2015/08/how-to-pick-shrimp-varieties-freshness-guide.html" target="_blank">also note</a> that the organic domestic product tends to be the tastiest, as well.</p>
<p>Domestic shrimp catch is also down year over year. For the month of June, the Gulf catch is roughly half of what it was in the previous June, according to the <a href="http://www.shrimpalliance.com/dismal-june-as-shrimp-landings-drop-to-record-lows-prices-fall/" target="_blank">Southern Shrimp Alliance</a>. That&#8217;s due partly to some lingering effects of 2010&#8217;s Deepwater Horizon oil spill, but also because market pressures from imported shrimp and high gas prices have forced many Gulf shrimpers out of the market entirely. Bad news for them, and bad news for all of us shrimp-lovers.</p>

<description><p>Beware of these plants—or parts of these plants—which you probably eat and enjoy often!</p>

<content:encoded><div><img src="http://modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/deadlyplants.jpeg"/></div><h4><br>When Europeans first encountered the tomato on their earliest visits to the New World, it was feared. A bright red—<em>suspiciously</em> bright red—fruit in the same family as the <a href="http://www.mnn.com/your-home/organic-farming-gardening/photos/13-plants-that-could-kill-you/deadly-nightshade" target="_blank">Deadly Nightshade</a>, a legendary poisonous plant? No, thank you!</h4><p>The tomato, of course, is not poisonous, but the Europeans were right to be wary of it. There are plenty of fruits, vegetables, tubers, and other plants that we heartily consume that are, secretly, dangerous to our health if prepared or eaten improperly. Here are some you may not have known about.</p>
<h2 class="mf-h2 mf-heading-align-left">1. Tomato</h2>
<p>I know, I just said the tomato <em>isn&#8217;t </em>poisonous. The fruit isn&#8217;t, but the leaves, roots, and stem (and, in limited doses, even some unripe fruit) are rich in tomatine, an alkaloid that&#8217;s mildly toxic to humans. <a href="http://jn.nutrition.org/content/126/4/989.full.pdf" target="_blank">It won&#8217;t kill you</a>, unless you chow down pounds and pounds of it, but it is likely to cause you some gastrointestinal distress.</p>
<div id="attachment_39141" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tomato.jpeg"><img class="wp-image-39141" src="http://modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tomato.jpeg" alt="Flickr user Swong95765" width="600" height="400"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Flickr user <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/29487672@N07/14566173188/in/photolist-852kVe-ocarP3-57BSet-6UrDvo-2DW5pw-dkHDiH-oc8FL4-p46Dut-tNwKMx-54heMW-a9YjSS-4ovjyU-drt1Fx-6KuuUa-owmdUt-2CpWc1-oaSLxq-drtcnh-pd5TMe-5qzZGw-p6sE7M-ai9zss-nTcPfy-5789t7-6XNKgS-dbon4z-oLSNDP-az2irR-dVBXk4-fSWnNa-2ouo4R-oLSj8d-jKnhtk-oLS7Lp-UtAEk-p4jXou-8KwP94-nTcKLk-caH7Pd-oSyqo6-nTcPQS-ihtTHM-oLSPUf-7NX3CQ-p4mWP2-nTcKwH-nJc3Qu-p4jY3A-5KdEsA-7nSi7j">Swong95765</a></p></div>
<h2 class="mf-h2 mf-heading-align-left">2. Apples, Cherries, and Apricots</h2>
<p>The seeds of all of these fruits are not considered edible; they&#8217;re hard, bitter, and unpleasant. That bitter flavor is a protective element: The plant puts it there to discourage animals like</p>
<p>us from destroying them. And it comes from a substance called amygdalin, which turns into cyanide when it comes into contact with acids in the human digestive system. Cherries, apricots, peaches, and nectarines have the substance in much higher concentrations than apples, but all of the seeds and pits in these fruits are fantastically tough. Even if you swallowed some? No big deal. Your body will simply pass them out. That said, please do not pulverize and then consume cherry pits.</p>
<div id="attachment_39142" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/peach.jpeg"><img class="wp-image-39142" src="http://modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/peach.jpeg" alt="Flickr user Forrest and Kim Starr" width="600" height="450"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Flickr user <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/forest-and-kim/17043341910/in/photolist-rY4zLA-fDTJsJ-8Ea8zA-wSRc5Q-vWHaTn-dTs39U-a9x6jQ-boCWRC-7c1xxQ-eW7JVP-2GPJCV-csV28j-csUYcq-csUZxL-csV1mJ-5irBh5-5juTZM-dTshX9-cDh3P9-cDh1Dd-cDgYgy-cDh2HG-6JxGW6-5LQGBB-nH8rvL-ajEydF-3tSUq-afxnaC-bjNKNf-8xGdXu-oakrco-bBj5au-52dUQ-5cbhdR-fDA6oc-cDgZtG-fUQ8zH-dGZgd4-62rTaM-6HePBE-8MyGbt-5xFb2m-dxR5ko-cGafLG-cGafz9-5xFaZ5-5xFbcC-s83Wp9-bmiGmp-ohozqs">Forrest and Kim Starr</a></p></div>
<h2 class="mf-h2 mf-heading-align-left">3. Kidney Beans</h2>
<p>Many legumes can cause mild gastrointestinal distress when undercooked, but red kidney beans (the kind almost always used in chili) are special. Kidney beans contain phytohaemagglutinin, a chemical compound that I will always have to copy and paste because, are you kidding me with that word? Ingestion of even just a few undercooked kidney beans can cause serious diarrhea and vomiting. <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/CausesOfIllnessBadBugBook/ucm071092.htm" target="_blank">According to the FDA</a>, it&#8217;s not fatal and rarely results in hospitalization, but it&#8217;s fairly common for people to end up sick after chomping down on some merely soaked beans.</p>
<div id="attachment_39143" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/kidney.jpeg"><img class="wp-image-39143" src="http://modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/kidney.jpeg" alt="Flickr user dominik18s" width="600" height="450"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Flickr user <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/55571726@N05/8143392606/in/photolist-bY7Y4s-bBTnNY-bY7WGh-dpB1UN-gmPTrt-7Z9YZ4-4KejPF-oPNQEL-oPPnj8-af4gq8-8gLm37-dtVgS-7aD5mX-6B7q1D-bxExzW-e5mcGS-aTt4Rv-8gH5sn-8gLma1-83KgWW-8gH5mD-bkWRnr-ssSdYX-7k5wf4-e1D4br">dominik18s</a></p></div>
<h2 class="mf-h2 mf-heading-align-left">4. Rhubarb</h2>
<p>Rhubarb, a springtime stalk most commonly used in the creation of America&#8217;s best pie, the strawberry-rhubarb, is a very strange plant indeed. Most often used in sweet applications, it&#8217;s a sour vegetable that looks like crimson celery. And its leaves are spectacularly poisonous. Rhubarb leaves are very high in oxalic acid, which quickly causes kidney failure in humans. About 25 grams of pure oxalic acid is the average amount needed to kill a human. That said, rhubarb leaves aren&#8217;t pure oxalic acid, and it would take around 11 pounds of the leaves to secure that much. But still! I&#8217;d stay away.</p>
<div id="attachment_39144" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/rhubarb.jpeg"><img class="wp-image-39144" src="http://modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/rhubarb.jpeg" alt="Flickr user Emma Forsberg" width="600" height="450"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Flickr user <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/echoforsberg/2569175467/in/photolist-4V2GmK-4V6RaN-6z3z7L-22XPfE-4H7HTg-ewM1Mj-9S1jGh-6kSS2F-2eJCPj-eRTXkn-a8MBFx-6GXMNP-cR5z65-cR5z1S-u6VreU-6yYtNX-6yYtLF-6z3z4S-6XQp3c-e4tNnn-7YxwZX-4NU9bb-9HJJRV-nKR9BR-tktQ8c-tZJXWs-5RfNWN-4cjnSi-5jjhhP-8a7jFM-22XPhY-7w8m22-4MaR9z-6wW34f-6dKEP9-7W7nDN-5joBVW-8a7jRX-9PXiby-837WbF-f9UWj-84FM1E-nAzMYc-6mo78L-5RfP97-ad9fWA-eWynD-daWCR6-6mmSAV-6H2S33">Emma Forsberg</a></p></div>
<h2 class="mf-h2 mf-heading-align-left">5. Asparagus</h2>
<p>Like the rhubarb, the part of the asparagus plant that we love—the young stems—are perfectly safe to eat. But the asparagus hides a deceptive, nasty secret: Its fruit, which are bright red berries, are toxic to humans. Just a handful can cause vomiting and diarrhea, though <a href="http://www.asparagus-friends.com/asparagus-knowledge/poisonous-asparagus/" target="_blank">a bit of charcoal will clear that right up</a>, according to the excellently named Asparagus Friends site.</p>

<h2 class="mf-h2 mf-heading-align-left">6. Cashews</h2>
<p>Cashews are another delicious product that should never, ever be eaten raw. (When you buy them, they&#8217;ve usually been roasted.) Native to the Amazon, the cashew is not really a nut, but rather a seed that protrudes oddly from the bottom of a fruit (also edible, though rarely seen outside the tropics) called the cashew fruit. You may have noticed that cashews are never found in their shell as almonds or peanuts are, and that&#8217;s because when raw, they&#8217;re covered with anacardic acid, closely related to the acid that makes poison ivy so irritating. It&#8217;s much worse when you eat it.</p>

</description>
<content:encoded><div><img src="http://modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/eggs.jpeg"/></div><h4><br>Banning the practice of caging chickens, pigs, and calves seems like the least we can do to ensure both quality of life and safety for the animals we eat. A new ballot measure in Massachusetts would mandate such a ban statewide—but it's attracting criticism from interest groups.</h4><div class='ctx-sidebar-container' id='contextly-fEUFDzesvu7KUu38PUH41CJwXqyPNFiL'></div>
<p>In 2016, if several animal rights groups, including the Humane Society of the United States, have their way, Massachusetts voters will be presented with a ballot initiative setting a few basic restrictions on chickens, pigs, and cows, similar to <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_2,_Standards_for_Confining_Farm_Animals_(2008)" target="_blank">a California measure</a> passed in 2008. Industry groups are, predictably, freaking out.</p>
<p>The measure would establish, by 2022, some comparatively minimal standards, but those standards would be applicable to all items produced or sold in the entire state of Massachusetts. All eggs would have to be produced in cage-free environments. All pork would have to come from pigs not raised in crates. And all veal would have to come from calves in enclosures above a minimum. These are all very reasonable demands, adhering to only the most basic animal rights concern of giving livestock enough room to, literally, move at all.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/08/19/ballot-push-would-mandate-cage-free-eggs/IW2C2aPBiYH6xZi1jqePtL/story.html" target="_blank"><em>The Boston Globe</em></a> finds that not everyone sees it that way. They reported, &#8220;&#8230; the food industry warned it would raise prices and hurt family farmers, and the National Pork Producers Council called it an effort to advance a &#8216;national vegan agenda.&#8217; &#8221; Putting aside the insanity of calling this a &#8220;national vegan agenda,&#8221; the price raise seems like a legitimate concern. Eggs, in particular, are so cheap as to provide an essential low-cost source of protein for poorer families. Would this hike up the price too high to be affordable by the masses?</p>
<p>Not so much, says the Humane Society. Paul Shapiro of the Boston Humane Society told <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news_opinion/local_coverage/2015/08/humane_society_cage_free_costs_for_mass_farm_animals_minimal">Boston Herald Radio</a> that, &#8220;In fact the egg industry did an economic analysis looking at what it would cost egg producers to go cage-free. And what they found is that it’s about a penny an egg more.&#8221; It&#8217;s more than that, to be fair, and requires a substantial investment up front to modify and often build entirely new enclosures that are compliant; <a href="http://civileats.com/2014/09/03/what-a-difference-a-cage-makes-the-battle-over-humane-egg-production-in-california-heats-up/" target="_blank">a Civil Eats article found</a> that it can cost medium-size producers millions of dollars in upgrades.</p>
<p>But after those upgrades, the cost is slight, in the realm of 25 percent more. That doesn&#8217;t mean, necessarily, 25 percent more for consumers: Wholesale prices, even during this summer when <a href="http://modernfarmer.com/2015/06/how-can-egg-prices-be-going-up-while-chicken-prices-are-going-down/" target="_blank">egg prices have spiked</a>, are only around <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/17/business/bird-flu-sends-egg-prices-up-but-slowing-demand-prevents-shortages.html?_r=0" target="_blank">$1.60 per dozen</a>, and when stabilized, small-size eggs average <a href="http://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/pybshellegg.pdf" target="_blank">less than a dollar per dozen</a>. Even a 25 percent bump in prices doesn&#8217;t make for much of a difference in terms of actual retail prices, as long as retailers don&#8217;t similarly pass along the costs to consumers.</p>
<p>Regardless, this is a huge step forward for animal rights activists and a big move for modernizing the livestock industry in America. The next step: the Attorney General must declare the initiative constitutional, at which point the animal rights groups can begin collecting signatures.</p>

</a>Wisconsin requires its cheese makers to complete an internship before earning their licenses to make cheese on their own. The BiFrost Farms owners believe, from personal experience, that having that internship at a small or micro-facility is the most rewarding way to do it. Before they dive into the wish-granting business, however, the owners need to make critical renovations to their facility to become licensed as a dairy and farmstead cheese-making operation. Donate to earn goat-themed swag, a wine-and-cheese tour, or have a goat kid named after you this coming spring.</p>

</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;">VertiCrop is an agricultural apparatus that allows 16 acres worth of food to be grown in a warehouse of just 6,500 square feet, and it only uses 8 percent of the water conventional farming uses. For these reasons, <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1934027_1934003_1933961,00.html" target="_blank"><em>Time</em> magazine dubbed it</a> one of the 50 Greatest Inventions of the Year in 2009. The company&#8217;s current landlord in Vancouver won&#8217;t renew their lease, so they need funds to move to a new facility. Donate to VertiCrop and you could score some of their delicious greens.</span></p>

</a>A husband-and-wife duo created a farm for street kids in Eldoret, Kenya—young boys cast away from their families, or ones who ran away from home—to help give meaning and direction to their lives. The Tumaini Center, as it&#8217;s called, has five fish ponds and fields for papaya, passion fruit, and other fruit. The Center provides kids with education and experience to potentially one day be an environmental educator within their community, as well as something else: fresh, delicious food. The Center is in need of more tools, more plants, and better equipment.</p>

For 30 years, Hackney City Farm—the &#8220;busiest city farm in London&#8221;—has supported their community with fresh produce. The farm offers opportunities to learn how to plant crops and care for livestock, and is also a registered school for children excluded from mainstream education. After many years, an increase in operational costs has put Hackney City Farms in jeopardy. Donating could earn you a free pottery class (one of the many classes they offer) on their grounds, or even a ride on a donkey-drawn cart.</p>

<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://modernfarmer.com/2015/08/farmers-almanac-predictions-2015/">Hooray: The Old Farmer&#8217;s Almanac Predicts a Harsh Upcoming Winter</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://modernfarmer.com">Modern Farmer</a>.</p>
</description>
<content:encoded><div><img src="http://modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/farmersalmanac.jpeg"/></div><h4><br>A curious thing about farming is that no matter how much technology is thrust onto it—<a href="http://modernfarmer.com/2014/01/precision-hawk/"_target="_blank">drones</a>, automation, megacorporations, satellites—there's still an element of folksy mysticism in creating food from seed.</h4><div class='ctx-sidebar-container' id='contextly-URPHBv05U5Y5fzsAyZdc0XYVFHEhEYpm'></div>
<p>Perhaps that&#8217;s why the Old Farmer&#8217;s Almanac, the oldest continuously published periodical in the United States, is still able to make news with its weather predictions. For what it&#8217;s worth, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/old-farmers-almanac-predicts-cold-snowy-winter/" target="_blank">the Almanac predicts</a> a harsh, bitterly cold and snowy winter this year.</p>
<p>Founded in 1792, the Old Farmer&#8217;s Almanac is a strange, quirky publication published annually. (It&#8217;s also changed its name a few times from the Farmer&#8217;s Almanac to the Old Farmer&#8217;s Almanac, though there is another, similar publication currently called the Farmer&#8217;s Almanac. It&#8217;s all very confusing.) The publication is mostly made up of long-range weather forecasts, guides to specific days ideal for planting, astronomical and astrological data, recipes, and various agriculture-related articles.</p>
<p>Its weather predictions are based on what are called the &#8220;<a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/normals/usnormals.html#WHATARENORMALS" target="_blank">climate normals</a>,&#8221; a 30-year average prepared by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But, really, anyone has access to NOAA&#8217;s data, and the Old Farmer&#8217;s Almanac veers away from it by peppering in what&#8217;s basically a secret recipe, guarded as seriously as Coke&#8217;s. According to the Almanac:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Over the years, we have refined and enhanced that formula with state-of-the-art technology and modern scientific calculations. We employ three scientific disciplines to make our long-range predictions: solar science, the study of sunspots and other solar activity; climatology, the study of prevailing weather patterns; and meteorology, the study of the atmosphere. We predict weather trends and events by comparing solar patterns and historical weather conditions with current solar activity.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that studying sunspots is not an accepted method of weather prediction; only the Almanac seems to think this is a valuable bit of data. And its predictions are not fantastically accurate; <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00431672.1981.9931980#.Vd3abNNVhBc" target="_blank">a 1981 study</a> from John E. Walsh and David Allen found that the Old Farmer&#8217;s Almanac predicted deviations from the average with barely over 50 percent accuracy. Not bad! But also, like, not great. The Almanac also predicted &#8220;<a href="http://www.almanac.com/content/global-warming-wane" target="_blank">global cooling</a>&#8221; back in 2009.</p>
<p>Most farmers <a href="http://modernfarmer.com/2014/05/farmers-almanac-isnt-farmers-anymore/" target="_blank">don&#8217;t rely on the Almanac anymore</a>, not with all the fantastically advanced technology out there these days—and especially since farming continues to be a cutthroat business of razor-thin margins. But that doesn&#8217;t mean they don&#8217;t read it; it&#8217;s an entertaining, funny, and ballsy publication. After all, people still turn out to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, each year to see if the groundhog predicts six more weeks of winter.</p>

                                                    <content:encoded><div><img src="http://modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bahamas-swimming-feral-pigs.jpg" /></div><h4><br>There’s an island in the Bahamas where <a href="http://www.bahamas.com/swimmingpigs"> feral pigs</a> play in the sand, lay in the sun like overweight beach-bunnies, and swim out to boats to be fed by tourists. About 20 pigs and piglets live on the uninhabited island of Big Major Cay, in Exuma, the Bahamas, on what has been dubbed “Pig Beach.”</h4><div class='ctx-sidebar-container' id='contextly-G9i3pQheIdvmtktttFMvjYPw3F9euVlf'></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’ve become quite the media darlings, and the story of these amiable porkers makes the rounds every so often. They even inspired a children’s book, </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Secret-Island-Jennifer-Nolan/dp/0615407218" target="_blank"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Secret of Pig’s Island</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Jennifer R. Nolan, and a song called &#8220;Pig Island&#8221; by children’s author </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0761126368/ref=nosim/?tag=tso-20" target="_blank">Sandra Boynton</a>. (It&#8217;s sung by none other than Scott Bakula.) </span>But behind the images of cute piglets doggy-paddling among smiling visitors, there are some interesting questions. The first: Is it unusual for pigs to swim? The second: How did these pigs get to an uninhabited island in the Bahamas?</p>
<p>To answer our first query, we turned to Dr. Harry Snelson, the director of communications for the <a href="https://www.aasv.org/" target="_blank">American Association of Swine Veterinarians</a>. He says he’s no “expert on swimming pigs,” but then goes on to enlighten us on porcine swimming habits, so we feel he’s more than qualified to answer.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pigs are natural swimmers when the situation necessitates,” he tells </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern Farmer</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an email. “In my experience, they are adequate to strong swimmers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s interesting about these Bahamian pigs is that they seem to enjoy swimming—but remember that they are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://modernfarmer.com/2014/03/pigheaded-smart-swine/" target="_blank">intelligent animals</a> who</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are motivated by food, so it’s possible their partiality to frolicking in the waves is based on knowing the kind of behavior for which suckers, we mean, <em>tourists</em>, will generously reward them.</span></p>
<div class="mf-pullquote-sc mf-pullquote-sc-left"><p class="mf-pullquote-sc-quote">For hundreds of years, pigs, and other livestock, from cattle to goats to chickens, were brought by European explorers by ship, and the animals often found their way onto various islands where they were heretofore unknown. </p></div>
<p>Ok, we’ve sorted that out. Let’s turn to the second question. For hundreds of years, pigs, and other livestock, from cattle to goats to chickens, were brought by European explorers by ship, and the animals often found their way onto various islands where they were heretofore unknown. It&#8217;s worth noting that the introduction of these pigs, and other livestock, by Europeans onto <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=7YC3cYhGMOcC&amp;pg=PA371&amp;lpg=PA371&amp;dq=pedro+mascarenhas+release+of+pigs&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Clj67JQ1Un&amp;sig=n8ef1_QSeOe58qcAeYVlSEDBCII&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBGoVChMI6djz47rExwIVhlo-Ch1bnQU4#v=onepage&amp;q=pedro%20mascarenhas%20release%20of%20pigs&amp;f=false" target="_blank">various islands</a> around the world had (and, in some cases, continues to have) <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=qtS9TksHmOUC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=marooned+pig&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pU9Q2KJXjU&amp;sig=Atmyacbe2Fra2b-SZ8Ho8Tbnu-I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAWoVChMIgeqflbPExwIVSfI-Ch2dUgD7#v=onepage&amp;q=marooned%20pig&amp;f=false" target="_blank">devastating effects</a> on the native flora and fauna. But regardless, the standard belief was that the livestock was dumped there for later use by sailors. Whether this was true or not was a bit fuzzy, and since historians love a good mystery, we contacted the <a href="http://www.navyhistory.org/" target="_blank">Naval Historical Foundation</a> in Washington, D.C. They put us in touch with Michael J. Crawford, the senior historian at the <a href="http://www.history.navy.mil/" target="_blank">Naval History and Heritage Command</a>.</p>
<p>According to Crawford, by the seventeenth century there “were domesticated pigs that had gone wild living on several Caribbean islands,” and were known in French as <em>cochon marrons</em> or “marooned pigs.” Crawford couldn’t say whether the animals “were deliberately released or whether they escaped into the wild.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A short time after hearing from Crawford, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">received an email from Commander Dave Winkler of the U.S. Navy Reserve (Retired), a member of the Naval Historical Foundation. He tells us he “got a tip” that when the British arrived in nearby Bermuda, “they found pigs left by the Spanish or Portuguese.” This is interesting, since, in doing our own research, we found solid evidence that in 1512 at least one Portuguese explorer, </span><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=8IkvLQtkpwYC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;dq=marooned+pig+on+purpose&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBGoVChMI55-I-LnExwIVB8o-Ch0VLgrK#v=onepage&amp;q=marooned%20pig%20on%20purpose&amp;f=false" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pedro Mascarenhas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, released pigs, goats, and chickens, onto the island of Mauritius, located in the Indian Ocean. So, in at least one instance dumping pigs onto uninhabited islands was a purposeful practice. While not definitive, it at least gets us closer to an answer on how the swimming pigs could have found their way onto Big Major Cay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a bonus, Crawford clued us in on some pretty cool trivia. He says the frame on which early <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=YRM-RpBiyTEC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=marooned+pigs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAWoVChMI4JKY6LjExwIViDY-Ch12FAUw#v=onepage&amp;q=marooned%20pigs&amp;f=false">feral-pig hunters</a> used to barbecue the pork was called a <em>boucan</em>, from which was derived the word <em>buccaneer</em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Th</span>e term was eventually “transferred to the pirates of the Caribbean, who also ate the barbecue, and many of whom had started as hunters.” So, all you Tampa Bay fans are rooting for a team named after a barbecue grill—just so you know.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s an even bigger bonus: an early 18th-century recipe (well, actually more like general cooking guidelines &#8230; they were pirates, after all) found in the book </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Sea-Rovers-Practice-Techniques/dp/1574889117" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The Sea Rover’s Practice</em>,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in case you want to make some pirate-inspired barbecued pork for yourself. The author, Benerson Little, says to slather pork with lime, salt, pepper, and crushed pimento and grill the meat. The buccaneers would also put this marinade inside the pig&#8217;s belly along with various game birds. If you want to be authentic, throw some pork bones and skin into the cooking fire (they believed it added flavor to the meat), and make a sauce of the same ingredients as above for dipping. Apparently, you also have to drink lots of rum while eating the dish. Or so we&#8217;re told.</span></p>

                                                    <content:encoded><div><img src="http://modernfarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/goat-farm-e1440536800200.jpg" /></div><h4><br>Paul and Leslie Spell own <a href="http://www.humbleheartfarms.com/" target="_blank">Humble Heart Farms</a>, a goat farm and creamery in northern Alabama with a fabulous herd. They recently put their farm up for grabs: Rather than sell it, though, the retiring owners are holding <a href="http://www.goatdairyessay.com/" target="_blank">an essay contest</a> to get the farm into the hands of another worthy farmer—experienced or wannabe.</h4><div class='ctx-sidebar-container' id='contextly-CC0vEsfiLBGhVCqM2BVI9Xt8C8YvJms1'></div>
<p><a href="http://www.waaytv.com/appnews/too-good-to-be-true-elkmont-couple-taking-essays-to/article_82151124-eeb8-11e4-8328-fbd4a7ebfdb6.html" target="_blank">According to WAAY TV</a>, the couple originally tried to sell the farm but hit a roadblock when those interested couldn’t afford the $350,000 price tag. They were inspired by Janice Sage, the owner of Maine&#8217;s Center Lovell Inn and Restaurant, who held <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/03/11/maine-innkeeper-inundated-with-essays-for-giveaway-contest/V2XQwwSi1qKkYbGXXk4XGM/story.html" target="_blank">an similar contest</a> to give away the ownership of her business.</p>
<p>Entrants must <a href="http://nebula.wsimg.com/ea85768f9b109ce1b68bf1122b2a3d30?AccessKeyId=4004423FB2C7CB4F7ACA&amp;disposition=0&amp;alloworigin=1" target="_blank">write and submit an essay</a> that, in 200 words or less, persuades the current owners, as well as a small panel of independent judges, why he or she is the perfect candidate to take on 20 acres, 85 goats, and their beloved goat-cheese operation. There is a $150 entry fee which, if there are at least 2,500 entries, will cover the remaining mortgage and arm the winner with $20,000 in start-up costs.</p>
<p>The Spells opine that there are two reasons why people daydream of dairy but don’t latch: finances and opportunity. The cost, both outright and day-to-day, can be too large for some to handle. On top of that, it takes time and work to become established and profitable.</p>
<p>The couple <a href="http://www.waaytv.com/appnews/too-good-to-be-true-elkmont-couple-taking-essays-to/article_82151124-eeb8-11e4-8328-fbd4a7ebfdb6.html" target="_blank">told</a> WAAY TV that they, “hope to change someone’s life with their offer,” and plan to teach the new owners the ins and outs of the goat-cheese game. And don&#8217;t worry, novices: One of Humble Heart&#8217;s in-house cheesemakers is staying on board.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to say they won&#8217;t have struggles or stuff to figure out, but they are going to start with a product that has a following,&#8221; Leslie said to WAAY TV. &#8220;They can pick it up and start running and I am so excited to see where they take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Where will the Spells be once the new owners take on the farm? They’ll be in Costa Rica, teaching similar skills to missionaries starting goat farms.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.goatdairyessay.com/rules.html" target="_blank">contest rules</a> and <a href="http://nebula.wsimg.com/ea85768f9b109ce1b68bf1122b2a3d30?AccessKeyId=4004423FB2C7CB4F7ACA&amp;disposition=0&amp;alloworigin=1" target="_blank">enter here</a> by October 1, 2015. You might think it sounds too good to be true, but, trust us, they&#8217;re not kidding around.</p>
