<h2 id='p-1'>Soviet Lenses</h2>
<p>What happened was, since I got on board the Fujifilm soul train via the mighty
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=fujifilm%20x-e1&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Afujifilm%20x-e1&amp;sprefix=fujifilm%20x-%2Caps&amp;tag=ongoing-20&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps">Fuji X-E1</a>
and the astoundingly-good little Fujinon XF35 35m f/1.4, I’ve been tracking
the Fuji-X-rated blogs, where I ran across Jonas Dyhr Rask’s
<a href="http://jonasraskphotography.com/2013/06/23/vintage-standard-lens-shootout/">Vintage Standard Lens Shootout</a>,
where I heard about the Helios 44m-4 58mm F/2.0.  I hated some of the
more-garish
pix in his <a href="http://jonasraskphotography.com/2013/05/17/helios-44m-4-58mm-f2-review/">review
of the lens</a> but was struck by its potential.</p>
<p>A little research suggested that this product of the USSR-that-was falls into the vanishingly-small
category of pretty-damn-good lenses you can EBay for cheap.  So I EBayed one
from somewhere in the Ukraine, and also an M42-screwmount-to-Fujinon-X-mount
adapter from somewhere else on EBay.  It cost me less than $100 for both put
together, including shipping. Here’s the first picture I took with it.</p>
<img src="DSCF3840.png" alt="Floorlamp, Fuji X-E1, Helios 44m-4" />
<p>I didn’t think about that one much and it still came out OK, but just like
the weight-loss ads on TV say, this is not a typical result. The lens is
<em>difficult</em>. Since everything is manual, you have to think hard about
focus <em>and</em> aperture <em>and</em> shutter speed <em>and</em> ISO on
every damn shot. You have an important ally in this struggle, namely the Fuji
cameras’ manual-focus-assist mode, which is pretty magical. Having said that,
at least half of my shots come out too light or too dark. And having said
<em>that</em>, the remarkable depth and quality of the Fuji raw files let me
save lots of those.  I’m thinking that a lens being difficult is not
necessarily a bad thing</p>
<p>As I write this, my twin nieces are visiting me; here’s one.</p>
<img src="DSCF3866.png" alt="Young woman, Fuji X-E1, Helios m44m-4" />
<div class="caption"><p>Check out her right earring’s shadow, and her left
eyelash.</p></div>
<p>Now, lots of sunshine makes everything easy and I didn’t have to work too
hard to dial that in. But then my niece got between me and the sun;
Soviet lenses don’t come with hoods, and the incoming local star totally made
it lose its shit; but in a not entirely unattractive way.</p>
<img src="DSCF3888.png" alt="Young woman and sunbeams, Fuje X-E1, Helios 44m-4" />
<p>The lens claims it goes down to f/2.0, but it’s got no stabilization plus
I’m wondering if there might be Soviet perfidy happening, because
I’ve had no luck in low light with this sucker, even at stupidly high
ISOs.  Haven’t given up on the challenge though.</p> 
<p>I should probably mention that the X-E1 with the adapter and Helios on it
is adorably steampunk.</p>
<img src="RUNE6841.png" alt="Fujifilm X-E1 with Helios 44m-4 58mm f/2 mounted" />
<p>See the strap on the left side of the picture?  That would be a Luma labs
Cinch, which turns out to be a real good choice.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Strapping</h2>
<p>I was an early adopter of the Luma Loop, partly because I know and admire 
<a href="http://duncandavidson.com/">James Duncan Davidson</a>, Luma’s
co-founder.  It’s served me well with my Pentaxes, to which I often attach
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2009/01/30/Lensing#p-2">big
fat lenses</a>; dangling by my thigh with instant-one-hand-grab potential is
just the thing for that form factor.</p>
<p>Unfortunately you can’t buy a new Loop any more
<a href="http://petapixel.com/2011/11/15/luma-loop-camera-strap-killed-off-after-patent-awarded-to-black-rapid/">for
legal reasons</a>.</p>
<p>I tried the Loop on the X-E1 but went back to the flimsy neckstrap
that came in its box.  Because that little camera wants to sit
softly on the middle of your chest; you can get it from there to your eye
faster than any big-lensed SLR down on your hip.  Plus you get to feel like a
glamorous old-school war-photog with a Leica.</p>
<p>I got my hands on a new  Luma-labs
<a href="http://www.luma-labs.com/cinch">Cinch</a> and tried it on the big
Pentaxes but it wasn’t obviously better. So I cinched it down to a real-short
position and swapped it in for the came-in-the-box strap, and wow, that’s just
the ticket.
The part that goes around the back of your neck is comfy and stable,
and you can position the camera anywhere between your sex organs and Adam’s
apple and have it up to your face with a chance to catch a passing orca or
tugboat.</p>
<p>I’m hooked, or cinched, or something.</p>

<p>I still haven’t written a thousand lines of Go; but what I have created
does useful work and (considering I had to learn a language and a bunch of
libraries along the way) didn’t burn that much time.  Herewith another batch
of
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2011/08/05/Permanoob">programming-permanoob</a>
reportage.</p>
<p>Previously:
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2013/06/16/Go-Love-Hate">Golang Diaries I</a>.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Illustrated Love Letter</h2>
<p>I’m a Web guy, and this speaks for itself:</p>
<pre><code>  resp, err := http.Get(uri)

  if err != nil {
    // horrible networking error, deal
    return failure
  }
  if resp.StatusCode != 200 {
    // grouchy server, deal
    return failure
  }
  mediaType := resp.Header.Get("Content-Type")
  if !strings.HasPrefix(mediaType, "application/json") {
    // bogus media type, deal
    return failure
  }

  defer resp.Body.Close()
  body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
  // body is a byte array with the server response</code></pre>
<p>Isn’t it pathetic that so many allegedly-mainstream languages don’t have
HTTP libraries that are this natural and idiomatic?</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Other Good Stuff</h2>
<p>Just like everyone says, Go makes concurrency a lot easier, without having
to think about monads or actors or transactions.  Just write simple linear
code (like that HTTP stuff above) and farm it out with go-routines and
channels.</p>
<p>Here’s sort of the core app logic in findIDP:</p>
<pre><code>  c := make(chan SearchResult)
  go timeout(c)
  go searchDNS(email, c, logger)
  go searchWebfinger(email, c, logger)
  go searchWebFist(email, c, logger)
  go matchDomainPatterns(email, c, logger)</code></pre>
<p>This is great... these all go do their thing and send the results back
whenever they get them (the <a href="http://webfist.org/">WebFist</a> flow
involves two different HTTP round-trips).  Then I watch the results trickle
in, bail on a time-out (currently 2 seconds, hmm), exit if I get an
authoritative result, otherwise select from among the others based on a bunch
of heuristics; I don’t spend a microsecond thinking about concurrency
issues.</p> 
<p>Some of the important virtues of Erlang here, without the dorky syntax and
general weirdness.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Happiness</h2>
<p>Matz wrote Ruby to make programmers happy, and it makes me happy.  Go
doesn’t particularly, but I’ll probably keep using it.</p>
<p>In Ruby code I find the smallest semantic gap between the image of the
problem in my head and the code on my screen.  In C, I find the smallest
semantic gap between the code on the screen and my understanding of what the
computer does.</p>
<p>Go gets real close to C in terms of the mapping onto the underlying
machine. There’s no reason that Go shouldn’t be as fast as C, and given the
quality of the team working on it, I’m sure it will be.</p>
<p>Go isn’t nearly as close as Ruby to the model in my head, but it’s a whole
hell of a lot closer than C is. This seems to me like a decent trade-off.</p>
<p>I stumbled across
<a href="http://go-lang.cat-v.org/quotes">Quotes About Go Programming</a> at
cat-v.org, and while the enthusiasts are kind of boring, I found I was
resonating with some of the more balanced takes, such as <i>If I had to
describe Go with one word it’d be “sensible”.</i> and <i>Why would you have a
language that is not theoretically exciting? Because it’s very useful.</i></p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Type -= Ceremony</h2>
<p>Static typing is <em>so much</em> less painful when you have good type
inference, as Go has.  I’m wondering how much of my cursing at Java
is really at all the declaration ceremony; it gets in the way of the work I’m
trying to do. Sometimes it’s helpful for readability to make a type visible,
and Go has the 
<code>var</code> facility for doing that.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>And Last, the Gripes</h2>
<p>It really irritates me, that in a modern programming
language, if I have an array full of type <code>Foo</code>, and a function
that converts <code>Foo</code> to <code>Bar</code>, there isn’t a
<code>map()</code> method that just gives me an array full of
<code>Bar</code>.  And then a separate <code>concurrentMap()</code>, which
does the obvious.</p>
<p>Golang is sort of half-pregnant; it provides the incredibly-useful
<a href="http://golang.org/ref/spec#Appending_and_copying_slices">append()</a>
method, that appends to any type of array.</p>
<p>No, this is <em>not</em> a plea for generics!  I just want some functional
goodies.</p>
<p>Speaking of missing goodies, a little introspection would be nice.  If you
glance at that findIDP code fragment above, it’s obvious that I have a lot of
different chunks of software that offer what you might call a
<code>Searcher</code> interface.  Why can’t I have them all in a directory
or package or somewhere and let the program figure out how many there are and
fire them all off?  Quite possibly it can and I just haven’t got there yet.</p>

<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>There were two nations’ birthdays in four days, thus a slow spell at work;
so we decided on a solid week of
<a href="/ongoing/What/The%20World/Cottage%20Life/">Cottage Life</a>.  And we invited all our friends
to come for lunch. Friends came, work got done, and photos got taken.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Work</h2>
<p>We have pretty good cell coverage on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keats_Island_(British_Columbia)">the island</a> from
<a href="https://mobility.telus.com/en/BC/home/">Telus Mobility</a> and get 3
bars of HSPA+;
<a href="http://www.speedtest.net/">Speedtest.net</a> says 3.5M down/2.3 up,
which is plenty enough for my job. We make a hotspot with a Galaxy Nexus;
reliability is better out on the deck than in the cabin, which is a better
place to work anyhow.</p>
<!--  Here’s a screen grab from a group meeting; full audio
and video for an hour, no problem.</p>
<img src="meeting-via-hspa.png" alt="Google meeting" />
<div class="caption"><p>The room was a little too small for the group;
normally we get to sit down to talk.  Note the evergreens behind my bald
head.</p></div>
-->
<p>The only major productivity hit working over there was from not
having my 30" Dell screen. It slowed me down more than I expected; If we were
going to make a habit out of this, our
quaint maritime cabin would have to find room for some sort of big honking
outboard monitor.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Cameras and Kids</h2>
<p>I’m still very much in honeymoon mode with my Fujifilm X-E1. But
that’s the road camera; the Pentax K-5 it replaced is the right choice for the
cabin. It feels huge compared to the Fuji, though it’s about the smallest
APS-C SLR on the market. But that’s not a big deal there, I’m usually sitting
on the deck or leaning on the railing as I shoot.  And also, for Pentax I have
the big heavy glass.  Most especially the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2009/06/21/Tokina-SL-400-f5.6">Tokina 400mm</a>
that lets me do things like this.</p>
<img src="RUNE6689.png" alt="Tugboat on Howe Sound" />
<div class="caption"><p>I have a thing for tugboats. They’re 100% utilitarian
and I still find them beautiful to look at.  I’d love to spend a couple of
working shifts on one sometime, see what that life is like.</p></div>
<p>And then there’s the
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NO5QVG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000NO5QVG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ongoing-20">Pentax
50-135mm f/2.8</a>, by any sane measure the best camera lens I’ve ever
owned. Yeah, I may rave on about the Tokina or the Fuji 35mm, but this thing
is razor-sharp at any aperture and zoom, focuses in a flash, and the
focal-length range hits a huge 80/20 point.</p>
<p>Mind you, it weighs more than the camera body and is the size of a small
cannon, but it makes shots like this easy.</p>
<img src="RUNE6813.png" alt="Boy leaps off boat" />
<div class="caption"><p>Yes, a boat is also a diving platform, given no
alternatives. The propensity among young males for leaping off the highest
available surface seems part of them, like their knees or noses.</p></div>
<p>Lest I give the impression that we play hard all the time, here we have a
7-year-old in a hammock with a tablet. Game designers of the world: This is
what you’re trying to achieve!</p>
<img src="RUNE6769.png" alt="Girl in hammock with tablet" />
<div class="caption"><p>This hammock was purchased at the
<a href="http://www.hilofarmersmarket.com/">Hilo farmers’ market</a>, and if
you ever get to the Big Island, I totally recommend a visit.</p></div>
<p>Much and all as I love both the Pentax and the Fuji, I
have to say that the Fuji raw files are better; the highlights here are blown
out to a degree that even the formidable powers of Lightroom 5 can’t entirely
rescue. With the X-E1 I’d have less harshness. But then again, I wouldn’t have
had a telephoto and she would have seen me coming.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>If You Know Me</h2>
<p>If you’re in Vancouver, at some point you’ll get an invite to come visit us
at the cabin. If you know me but are elsewhere and are coming here, let me
know in advance and let’s try to set up some island time.</p>

<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>There are
<a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/eu-officials-furious-at-nsa-spying-in-brussels-and-germany-a-908614.html">angry
voices sounding in Europe</a> over the NSA’s large-scale
indiscriminate information-gathering there. It’s perfectly possible to be
suspicious and cynical about the US spooks, a fan of Ed Snowden, and still
think those voices are those of either Euro-hypocrites or Euro-fools.</p>
<p>In general, I approve of espionage and yet intensely distrust
law-enforcement organizations. I think a healthy civic society should:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Aggressively regulate its own security establishment.</p></li>
<li><p>Worry intensely about overreach and privacy abuse by security
officials. </p></li>
<li><p>Empower those officials to watch its enemies closely and its
allies even more closely.</p></li>
<li><p>Assume that foreign security establishments will routinely try to
capture every word spoken and every picture taken.</p></li>
<li><p>Where there are useful measures that can be taken to protect citizens’
privacy from foreign snoops, take them.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-1'>Why Spying Is Good</h2>
<p>Governments are less likely to do risky things that might have the
side-effect of starting wars when they know that other governments know what
they’re up to.  It’s as simple as that.</p>
<p>And as long as religious leaders are out there teaching the clueless that
God wants them to kill, I want spooks trying to head them off.  Yes, I’m
wearing my atheist heart on my sleeve here, but face facts: 
Contemporary terrorism is by and large a faith-based activity.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Why Distrust and Regulate Spooks?</h2>
<p>Because every law-enforcement organization in history has had an
us-against-them psychology.  And every one has also had a
statistically-unsurprising number of members who are corrupt, paranoid, or
just stupid, and will abuse their access to privileged information.</p>
<p>And while the risk of a sudden lurch into tyranny seems remote in the
civilized nations of the developed world, a good way to keep that risk
low is to keep your security professionals on a damn short lease.</p>
<p>The notion that you need a search warrant to break down doors or tap phones
or unlock emails is absolutely a central keystone of civilized life. Anything
that weakens it is terribly dangerous.</p>
<p>I’m confident that Ed Snowden has done the world in general and America
in particular a favor, by forcing into the public conversation what most
“insiders” already knew.  Among other things, my impression is that the spook
organizations are ludicrously inefficient and wasteful.  Whether or not it’s a
good thing for them to be capturing all that information, it’s pretty likely
that whatever the benefits are, they’re not worth what we’re paying.  Let’s
talk about that.</p>
<p>What would be even more valuable to the public discourse would be some
public-finance insider opening the kimono on how much we’re actually paying
for whatever it is that funding the spooks is buying us.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Home Spooks Vs Foreign Spooks</h2>
<p>Assuming you’re not actually planning to bomb a legislature, it
seems obvious that your own government’s spies are way more dangerous to you
than are foreigners. Your own can put you on a no-fly list or hand you to a foreign
government to torture or quietly advise a funding agency that your research
proposals shouldn’t get a warm welcome or arrange that you go to secondary
inspection every time you re-enter your homeland.</p>
<p>And they can do any of these things because they’re paranoid or corrupt or
just stupid.  Which some proportion of them will always be.</p>
<p>Foreign intelligence pros are simply not apt to care that much about what
you do unless there are good reasons to think you’re a threat to them.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>So You Like Being Watched?</h2>
<p>Uh, no. I think it’s entirely sane to be paranoid, in a balanced way.  Use
HTTPS everywhere. Don’t share your location freely, trade it for things you
need. Bear in mind that your telephone company always knows where you are, and
has no business reason not to tell anyone in a uniform, if asked. 
And that your email provider, presented with a
proper warrant, will efficiently cough up yours, including those you
thought you’d deleted.  And that anything going any distance over the public
telephone network is probably being tapped by at least one government. And
that Internet-voice and Internet-video operators may not even ask for a
warrant before they spill your beans.</p>
<p>There are lots of perfectly-legal reasons to want privacy. If you act all
the time in a way that sensibly preserves yours, when one of those legal
reasons becomes important you suddenly won’t be acting different in an
attention-catching way.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Antispooking</h2>
<p>I’m not so idealistic as to think that the Canadian government has any
interest in defending my privacy from the NSA; it’s actually more likely that
they’re cheerfully handing anything they know over on request.  But if there’s
anything that a developed-world state could do to defend its citizens’ privacy from
barbarians equipped with listening technology, I hope they are.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>The Euro Angle</h2>
<p>So, the Germans are upset that the Yanks are listening in to whatever they
can?  Given that 9/11 was planned in Frankfurt, they can’t plausibly claim to
be surprised.  So like the title says, I’m thinking hypocrisy or
foolishness.</p>
<p>And since Germans in particular regulate their own security establishment
with what looks to me like an eminently intelligent and sanely-paranoid
framework, let’s rule out foolishness.</p>

<p>On Sunday I
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2013/06/30/Medium">wrote</a> <cite>On

<cite>Medium</cite>, after I posted

original piece, not counting those who might’ve read it in my feed. The
<cite>Medium</cite> version had had 455 reads.</p>
<p>Today, the numbers are 1560 for my blog (feed-exclusive) and 1700 or so at
Medium. But today, I glanced at the stats and got a shock: the
meta-piece had 13.3K feed-exclusive reads.  Huh?  A bit of poking around
reveals that those folks had mostly come from
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5968593">a Hacker News thread</a>,
where there’s worthwhile discussion of blogging in general and
<cite>Medium</cite> in particular.</p>
<p>I’m hoping something interesting falls out of this so I can write again at
four levels of meta.  Texas politics... where’s that again?</p>

<p>Last week I wrote 
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2013/06/26/Texas-Politics">Texas Politics</a>
about the legislative-gamesmanship theatrics around Wendy
Davis’ filibuster.  It did OK on the blog, nothing special.  Evan Hansen of
<a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a> reached out asking if I wanted
to republish there.  I couldn’t think of a good reason to do that, but then I
also couldn’t think of a good reason not to.  So here’s a blogger’s-eye view
of being a <cite>Medium</cite> author.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <cite>Medium</cite> version is
<a href="https://medium.com/gender-justice-feminism/2857662d6a01">Don’t Mess
With Them</a> and it’s better than my version, because I did a couple more
editing passes and tightened things up. Also, the presentation over there is
terrific; minimal and very readable.</p></li>
<li><p>The <cite>Medium</cite> authoring environment is excellent, gets right
out of the way. Everything I wanted to do was easy, with zero learning
curve.</p></li>
<li><p>The piece was written on the 26th.  I have some tens of thousands of
feed subscribers; it’s hard to measure, since I like the wide-open freedom of
constructing and serving my own feed. Some of them probably read the piece
but, since it’s a full-content feed,
there’s no need for them to visit the blog.  In addition, something over 1250
people came from somewhere external and read the piece.</p></li>
<li><p>The Medium
version has had 455 reads.</p></li>
<li><p>There’s too much stuff on Medium.  My piece got more or less exactly
zero notice until it got promoted to the 
<a href="https://medium.com/editors-picks">Editor’s Picks</a> stream.
I wonder why <cite>Medium</cite> would want to publish something if it weren’t
an editor’s pick?  There are 
millions of places on the Net to do self-publishing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Will I publish on Medium again?  Honestly, I’m not sure.  I’m 100% happy
with my own little space on the Web right here; but everyone should try new
things sometimes.</p>

<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>If you use Emacs, you can stop reading now.  If you don’t, there’s a
possibility that you may not be aware of an incredibly powerful
productivity-boosting tool that works in almost every OS X app.  Read on.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Take Control</h2>
<p>The trick I’m about to describe works whenever you’re editing text: Gmail,
Pages, Keynote, wherever. It
relies on the “Control” key, which is down on the lower left corner of most OS
X keyboards (but stay tuned for a trick to make it more accessible). The trick
is, hold down the “Control” key while you’re hitting another, for example “A”;
let’s call this “C-A”.</p>
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr><td><p><b>C-A</b></p></td><td><p>Go to the beginning of the line.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p><b>C-E</b></p></td><td><p>Go to the end of the line.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p><b>C-F</b></p></td><td><p>Go one character forward.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p><b>C-B</b></p></td><td><p>Go one character backward.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p><b>C-P</b></p></td><td><p>Go to the previous line.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p><b>C-D</b></p></td><td><p>Delete the character at the cursor.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p><b>C-N</b></p></td><td><p>Go to the next line.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p><b>C-K</b></p></td><td><p>Erase all the characters to the end of the
line.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p><b>C-T</b></p></td><td><p>Flip the character your cursor is on and the one
before it.</p></td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Not all these are available in all programs.  I’ve listed them in
decreasing order of availability;  C-K and C-T sometimes don’t work.  Also, you
get surprises; for example, in Firefox, if you hit Command-F to search, that
opens a little search window at the bottom and it steals C-A and C-F and a few
others.  Bad, <em>bad</em> Firefox!</p>
<p>Control-K is particularly useful when you’re in a Google search window and
it insists in filling in more words than you want to search for.  I.e., you
type in “owl dropping” and it insists you want “owl droppings photos”. Get as
far as you want, C-K, Enter, and there you go.</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>When you’re working hard with your keyboard, you can work harder and go
faster if you don’t have to take your fingers off the keyboard, which you do
most often to reach the arrow keys; only with these keystrokes, you
usually don’t need to.  So you can go faster.</p>
<h2>Fatter Control Key</h2>
<p>If you like these, you may become irritated that the control key is stuck
way down in the corner of the keyboard where you have to fish around for
it. So, here’s what you do:  Open the Mac system preferences, then the
Keyboard preferences, and down in the lower right corner of that screen
there’s a “Modifier Keys” button.  Open that up, and tell it to use the Caps
Lock key as the Control key. Who needs Caps Lock anyhow?  And having a big fat
Control key right there beside the “A” is pretty wonderful.</p>
<h2>Emacs</h2>
<p>These keystrokes were first seen in Emacs, which you don’t need to know
about for this to be useful,  but just
for background, here’s what noted geek/author
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson">Neal Stephenson</a> had
to say about it:</p> 
<blockquote><p>In the GNU/Linux world there are two major text editing
programs: the minimalist vi (known in some implementations as elvis) and the
maximalist emacs. I use emacs, which might be thought of as a thermonuclear
word processor. It was created by RichardStallman; enough said. It is written
in Lisp, which is the only computer language that is beautiful. It is
colossal, and yet it only edits straight ASCII text files, which is to say, no
fonts, no boldface, no underlining. In other words, the engineer-hours that,
in the case of Microsoft Word, were devoted to features like mail merge, and
the ability to embed feature-length motion pictures in corporate memoranda,
were, in the case of emacs, focused with maniacal intensity on the deceptively
simple-seeming problem of editing text. If you are a professional
writer – i.e., if someone else is getting paid to worry about how your words
are formatted and printed – emacs outshines all other editing software in
approximately the same way that the noonday sun does the stars. It is not just
bigger and brighter; it simply makes everything else vanish. – from
<a href="http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html">In the Beginning was the
Command Line (1998)</a></p></blockquote>

<p>If you weren’t watching the livestream (courtesy of
<a href="http://www.texastribune.org/2013/06/26/led-davis-democrats-defeat-abortion-legislation/">The Texas Tribune</a>) you missed an
astounding piece of drama.  I only caught the last 90 minutes, but wow.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Wendy</h2>
<p>The charisma and eloquence of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Davis_(politician)">Senator
Davis</a> was astonishing. By the time I started watching, she’d been silenced
by the Republican legislators’ tactics and just stood there, watching and
smiling.</p>
<img src="Sen-Davis.png" alt="Texas Senator Wendy Davis" />
<h2 id='p-2'>Gaming the System</h2>
<p>I don’t think the transparent sleaze of the efforts to rule 
her out of order were all that terrible. The whole point of being governed by
elected legislatures is that it’s rule-based, and wherever there are rules
they can be gamed, and <em>that’s OK</em>. Ms Davis gamed the rules to head
off an awful piece of legislation that would essentially restrict access to
abortion to rich women in urban centers. The Republicans gamed the rules to
try to push it through. 
The real issue is the legislated policy, not the legislative tactics.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Sports Metaphor</h2>
<p>Whatever the real issue was, those tactics were pretty damn gripping to
watch. At 2:57AM Texas time, the bill was
<a href="http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2013/06/wendy-davis-begins-filibuster-to-stop-omnibus-abortion-bill.html/">officially
dead</a>; and, if I may be forgiven a view through baseball lenses, this was
small 
ball; Beating 
out a bouncer to reach first, getting to second on a sacrifice and third on
a passed ball; then beating the throw home on a short fly out.</p>
<p><em>First</em>, Wendy Davis held the floor for all those hours and kept the
openings for opportunistic Points of Order to a minimum;
forcing the Repubs way into transparent-overreach territory.</p>
<p><em>Second</em>, the immense legislative skill of the Democratic Senators
in running out the clock. There were lots of them, but in particular,  
the lawyerly silver-haired lizard-skinned slow-talking Texas-drawling 
<a href="http://www.watson.senate.state.tx.us/">Senator Kirk Watson</a>
burned an incredibly valuable 15 minutes or so of the last hour 
politely dissecting
the finer points of the motion to close debate on the motion to
appeal the ruling on the motion to kill Wendy Davis’ filibuster so they could
pass the bill. I’d hire that guy to 
represent me in a complicated big-money litigation, <em>any time</em>.</p>
<img src="Kirk-Watson.png" alt="Texas Senator Kirk Davis" />
<div class="caption"><p>Senator Watson, courtesy of UStream contributor
<a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/christopherdido">ChristopherDido</a>.</p></div>
<p><em>Third</em>, the eloquence and timing of
<a href="http://www.vandeputte.senate.state.tx.us/">Senator Van de Putte</a>,
rushed to the debate from her father’s funeral, carefully ignored by the
Republican chair in a useful legislative delaying tactic, raising the stakes
from rules-gaming to gender-politics with “At what point must a female senator
raise her hand or her voice to be recognized over her male colleagues?”</p>
<p>Which only reinforced the subtext of pudgy old white Republican men
silencing strong-voiced women speaking for other women. This can’t be good for
them, 
electorally.</p> 
<p><em>Fourth</em>, the activists in the gallery who, when the 
majority had mercilessly squished all the Democratic legislative tactics, just
started 
screaming and wouldn’t shut up till the clock ran out. At ten minutes to
midnight, I 
said to my wife, equally fascinated beside me on the couch, “That gallery has
staying power” and yeah, they did.</p>
<p>The real inside-baseball Texas-legislature cognoscenti will have more to
say about how the Republican backup chair was out-dueled by the Democratic
point-of-parliamentary-inquiry veterans, on average at least twenty years
older than him by the look of them.  But at the end of the day it wouldn’t
have worked if a bunch of ordinary people hadn’t come to scream at the people
they elected; and I can’t imagine a more fundamental exercise of democratic
power.</p>
<p>What a show. My faith in the usefulness of democracy is refreshed.
And I’m not even American.</p>
<!--
talkig as long as we needed to talk, to talk that bill to death
on behalf of our democratic colleagues... we’ll take that
-->

<p>I just read Neil Gaiman’s
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062255657/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0062255657&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ongoing-20">The
Ocean at the End of the Lane</a> and it’s wonderfully done but I didn’t enjoy it.
There’s a good chance you might, though.</p>
<p>Gaiman is one of the very few writers whose books I just go ahead and buy
without waiting to read reviews or even sniffing the social-media fumes.
This book won’t change that even though it made me unhappy.</p>
<p>Gaiman’s in good form, so the magic here is magical, the people are real
(except for the ones that aren’t supposed to be), the monsters are monstrous,
and the ambiance is intensely felt: <em>You are there</em>.</p>
<p>But I didn’t like it because it scared the hell out of me.  
The situation is just way too plausibly horrible, even
if it involves an immortal intruder from outside our reality.  I had to put
the book down and 
go out on the back porch at one point, and nearly didn’t pick it up again.</p>
<p>But hold on; the horror involves a father and his 7-year-old and I’m one of
those and have one of those. So it was right there in my gut, the fear and
desperation of a kid finding a monster invading his family and sharing his
life.  But for people not quite so close to the situation, it might just be
pleasantly thrilling.</p>
<p>Ewwww.  But really, really well-done.  Lighten up next time please, Mr
G.</p>

<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>One of my jobs is browbeating people to turn on
<a href="http://www.google.com/landing/2step/">2-Step Verification</a>, and
it’s working; more and more people are.  Today I learned that we’ve got some
open-source technology you can use to add 2-factor to your own app.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Please Get Safe</h2>
<p>Seriously, if you haven’t already, and if someone hacking your Google
account would screw up your life, then
<a href="http://www.google.com/landing/2step/">start here</a> right now and
come back after you’ve turned it on.  I’ll wait.</p>
<p>What, you didn’t do it? You’re not convinced?  You think it’ll be
inconvenient? Wrong.  It’s super-smooth; every so often, when Google asks you to
refresh your login, it’ll ask you to enter a number that we send you by
SMS. Don’t like SMS? No problemo, just grab the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator">Google
Authenticator</a> app for your Android or Blackberry or iOS device, and it’ll
generate a code locally.</p>
<p>It’s just not inconvenient. What <em>is</em> inconvenient is having to
apologize to everyone when your account gets hacked and your friends all get
spammed or worse, scammed.  So please, get on board.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Add It To Your App</h2>
<p>I don’t think that apps should be doing their own authentication, I think
they should be farming that out to Identity Providers, the better to preserve
the sanity of their users. But if you really must authenticate people, give
serious thought to offering 2-factor.</p>
<p>It turns out that your app can use Authenticator too; 
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/wiki/KeyUriFormat">it
works with</a> those
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm">OATH
TOTP</a> constructs.  (Yes, that’s
OATH not OAuth, life is confusing.)  Dropbox is
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/363/en">already doing this</a>, so you’d
be in good company.</p>
<p>Authenticator is also an
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/">open-source
project</a>, which makes it easier to be confident about what it does and how
it works. Also, it would be perfectly reasonable and OK for you to fork it
(Apache license) for your own purposes.</p>

There’s not that much new information here, but it’s fun piece to read.</p>
<p>For something completely different, check out this early DPReview
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/previews/samsung-galaxy-nx">look at the
Galaxy NX</a>, Samsung’s big serious camera that’s also an Android Jellybean
device.  I’m sure there’s photographic gold in them thar hills somewhere.
At the moment I have no urge to abandon Fuji’s diminutive form factor
and fabulous Fujinon lenses, but if I get an idea for an Android app
that uses the camera hardware, that could change fast.</p>
<p>And for something completely different again, there’s this really rather
amusing
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/ricoh-gr">Ricoh GR comparative
review</a> (also in DPReview); comparative in the sense that the Ricoh faces
off against the Nikon Coolpix A.</p>
<p>I’m not a customer for the GR because, as I’ve
<a href="/ongoing/When/201x/2012/12/10/Cameras">written here before</a>, I
think 
a pocket camera should be primarily a good zoom lens with a camera on the back
(and your bigger camera should mostly wear opinionated prime
lenses). But still, there are lots of smart words in this comparo on the
directions that cameras are moving.</p>

<p>My Galaxy Nexus unfortunately Died The Death. It’ll boot and seem to
work, but as soon as you try to open an email or whatever, kiss it
goodbye. So I rummaged through the back of the closet and, well, it’s amazing
how little you can get by with.</p>
<p>I’d like to replace the GNexus with one of those pure-Android HTC Ones
they’re talking up, but you can’t get those yet so I needed a stopgap.
The closet yielded an old Nexus S which I put
my SIM in and turned on; up come some antique Android
version. </p>
<p>Also, it was broken; probably this is some best-forgotten engineering
build from three years ago.  The keyboard keeps vanishing while you type on
it, and basically nothing works.</p>
<p>So I ran out of patience and erased all the accounts and turned off WiFi
and mobile data and now it’s a dumbphone er I mean “Feature Phone”; it
makes and receives phone calls and SMSes and does that just fine.  I’m OK
because my Nexus 7 with 3G keeps me on the Net when I need that.  The combo
will get me through till I figure out how to score that HTC One.</p>
<p>But wait... just now I checked into some hotel or other on El Camino in
Silly Valley and its Internet wasn’t working (they rarely do). But it dawned
on me that the dumphone can still get 3G and make a hot spot, and so
I can still talk to the world.</p>
<p>I’m sure there’s a lesson to take away from all this; you figure it out.</p>

<p>I ran across

<a href="http://theresa.couchman.usesthis.com/">The Setup</a> (always
recommended), which convinced me to buy
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1481289985/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1481289985&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ongoing-20">The
Unmapped Lands</a>, and wow, is it ever fun.</p>
<p>There is <em>a whole lot of stuff</em> in this book; probably more
than really necessary, because the people in it are so
interesting. I was actually sort of hoping Ms Couchman would ease off on the
action a bit and just run with them a bit, but I never wasn’t
entertained. Let’s see, we start with a hardass witch in Albany, NY, and
then we get a demon and a smart rat and an Intuitive and a Magician and
an alternate-reality portal and a grimoire and dragons and giant spiders and,
yeah, there’s more, but you get the idea. It’s even coherent, mostly.</p>
<p>It’s her first &amp; only book.  Discovering someone with this much talent
just getting started, what a stroke of luck.</p>
