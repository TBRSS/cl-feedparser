 update - update list of available packages

 install - install packages
 remove  - remove packages

 upgrade - upgrade the system by installing/upgrading packages
 full-upgrade - upgrade the system by removing/installing/upgrading packages

<li>Support IDE disk again. (yes, I hadn't noticed ide-disk renamed to ide-gd_mod)</li>
<li>pre-located firmware (linux-firmware package will be installed if d-i detects your machine needs it. This image supports bnx2 and bnx2x also)</li>
<li>experimental WPA support (not tested)</li>
<li>[update on 28 Jun] Added ext4 support. You can choose ext4 filesystem at partition manager screen. Don't try to use ext4 for your root partition (or see <a href="/debian/d-i/#faq">FAQ</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>By the way,</p>

		<description>I updated Web service 'Debian HCL - Debian GNU/Linux device driver check &amp; report page' is an easy tool to check and see the support status of your hardware on GNU/Linux, with many improved features.Integrating the check page and submitted reports is convenience.The vendor tree view will make easier to find models what you'd like to see.Although Searching isn't implemented yet, I think new URL structure is friendly to search engine crawlers. I'll put Google search form on the page after Google crawls.Handling your submission is semi-automatic periodically. So please don't submit again and again even it won't be shown soon. :)This service is localized in English, Japanese, French, Spanish, Spanish-Argentina, Italian, Polish, German, Portguese, and Chinese (simplified) at this time, by using your Web browser language information. Because I introduced the GNU gettext system for internationalizing, it's easy to translate and update the translations. You can take template.pot file and translate in your language. If you'd like to translate in your language, please tell me. Have a fun!</description>
