&lt;p&gt;Then, it happens. A pause, a stammer, and &amp;#8220;well…uh…are you looking for anything full time or just…" and they trail off hoping—it seems—that I cut in with an exuberant &lt;em&gt;yes, of course!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#8217;t happen. I politely tell them, &lt;em&gt;no, I am only looking for contract or consulting work right now&lt;/em&gt;. Sometimes, this turns into a new lead; startups often need extra hands when it comes to design or front-end development. Other times, though, it results in a strange mix of disappointment and confusion, as though I&amp;#8217;ve made some sort of uncomprehendably poor life choice by not entertaining their exciting offer of full time employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s this stigma in the startup universe around being a contractor, consultant, or freelancer. A sort of confusion as to why we aren&amp;#8217;t we chasing the the big dreams, big wins, and big money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes down to it, I do what I do because it&amp;#8217;s not always about going &amp;#8220;big" and betting it all on a startup. It&amp;#8217;s not that I&amp;#8217;m dreaming small or using &amp;#8216;freelance&amp;#8217; as a euphemism for &amp;#8216;unemployed&amp;#8217; (far from that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I enjoy the freedom. I get to work with tens of companies, work on a huge variety of different tasks, and exercise (and grow) my skills in every possible way. In fact, I do much of what I&amp;#8217;d be doing at a (very small) startup—marketing, biz dev and sales, design, development, accounting—and perhaps considerably more. I get to have a broad, varied impact on many different people and businesses in a very direct way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It&amp;#8217;s true that there may be more stress and more worry—what if business slows down? Why is my client calling me in a panic at 1am? Some people seem to think I haven&amp;#8217;t yet realized the pitfalls and so-called &amp;#8220;horrors" of my chosen career path. However, at the end of the day, I&amp;#8217;m not looking for the stress free, worry free, perk-heavy job. I know it has it&amp;#8217;s ups and downs. Just like most early-stage startups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the work I do touches many people, I love maintaining a close relationship with my awesome clients, and I love being able to help companies stretch themselves in ways they would otherwise struggle to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, work has been so busy these days that I&amp;#8217;ve even been working on expanding, bringing in a partner and adding new resources to take on bigger and even more impactful work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do doesn&amp;#8217;t fit neatly into the definition of a &amp;#8216;startup&amp;#8217; and that&amp;#8217;s okay. Perhaps it&amp;#8217;s a small business—that&amp;#8217;s fine too. But don&amp;#8217;t be surprised or puzzled when someone says that they&amp;#8217;re a freelancer, contractor, or consultant and not looking to transition into a full-time job. &lt;span&gt;Most of us are pretty damn happy doing it—there are plenty of other options if we didn&amp;#8217;t. We might even be able to help you…without coming on full time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/57035586783</link><guid>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/57035586783</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2013 00:21:29 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>Give them an inch and they take $773,074,040</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/07e9d019df38dd30a0602874e49990c4/tumblr_inline_mmtqw8Oba51qz4rgp.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2012, Southwest Airlines began &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/30/travel/airline-seats"&gt;reducing seat pitch&lt;/a&gt;—better known as legroom—in their 737s by a &lt;strong&gt;single inch&lt;/strong&gt;, from 32" to 31". This allowed them to add an additional &lt;a href="http://www.seatguru.com/airlines/Southwest_Airlines/Southwest_Airlines_Boeing_737-700_new.php"&gt;six seats per flight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southwest runs, on average, &lt;a href="http://www.transtats.bts.gov/carriers.asp?pn=1"&gt;94,350 flights per month&lt;/a&gt; at an average price of just &lt;a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/story/2012-08-20/Southwest-raises-fares-others-follow/57165136/1"&gt;$141.72 per seat&lt;/a&gt;. These flights, according to the airline, are generally &lt;a href="http://swamedia.com/channels/Corporate-Fact-Sheet/pages/corporate-fact-sheet#dailydepartures"&gt;80% full&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means, every year &lt;strong&gt;that single inch earns them $&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;773,074,040&lt;/strong&gt; of additional revenue. I guess every little bit really does count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit (05/16/2013): It&amp;#8217;s been pointed out to me by a third party that an alternative—and perhaps more accurate—interpretation of the numbers results in revenues gains closer to $60–100M. Not nearly as much, but still nothing to sneeze at.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/50478689215</link><guid>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/50478689215</guid><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2013 01:14:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>Please stop using Twitter Bootstrap</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s be honest: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a great many of us are tired of seeing the same old Twitter Bootstrap theme again and again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Black header, giant hero, rounded blue buttons, Helvetica Neue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can customize the header to be a different color, maybe re-color some of the buttons, use a different font. Ultimately, however, that doesn&amp;#8217;t change anything—it still &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; like Bootstrap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I get it, really. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/"&gt;Twitter Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; is great for developers; all of the pieces are nicely laid out for you, use a consistent design language, and piece together like Lego. No design sense needed and no creativity involved. You just import the CSS file and go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But when you start to see the same layout &lt;a href="http://www.financialq.com/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.appfeed.net/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://fiveaday.co/"&gt;over&lt;/a&gt; again users begin to tune out. You&amp;#8217;ve lost me. Your design looks like one of 6,000 other sites out there. And not just the same general layout, but &lt;em&gt;the exact same components.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with Bootstrap is that it is so heavy-handed, so &lt;em&gt;prescriptive&lt;/em&gt;, that it is actually a nuisance to modify. It&amp;#8217;s easier to use the defaults. You certainly &lt;a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/"&gt;can modify it&lt;/a&gt; signficantly and, if you decide to use it anyway, I would encourage you to do so. But most people do not bother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are some times it is appropriate to use Twitter Bootstrap&amp;#8217;s defaults. Like for an &lt;a href="http://lamp.sangkrit.net/2012/10/06/bootstrap-admin-a-wordpress-dashboard-theme-based-on-twitters-bootstrap/"&gt;admin dashboard&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="http://fontcustom.com"&gt;open source project&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8217;s documentation, a prototype, or a weekend hackathon. However, once you go beyond the stage of small test project, it&amp;#8217;s time to think beyond the black header, blue buttons, and grey 1px outlined boxes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter Bootstrap&amp;#8217;s success has turned it into the Times New Roman of design.&lt;/strong&gt; It has a time and a place, but you wouldn&amp;#8217;t use Times New Roman on your startup&amp;#8217;s website, would you?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/43508972396</link><guid>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/43508972396</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 Feb 2013 16:16:39 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>The Productivity Catalyst</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Some of the most successful and productive people I&amp;#8217;ve ever met all have something they use to help them overcome procrastination. Some may call it a routine, or ritual. I like to call it the &lt;strong&gt;Productivity Catalyst. &lt;/strong&gt;It is the thing that pushes you to start working; to finally get that one thing done that leads to the next thing, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A productivity catalyst is simply something you do each and every time before you begin working. It puts you in the right mindset because it is what you &lt;em&gt;always &lt;/em&gt;do immediately before you start working&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ernest Hemingway &lt;a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4825/the-art-of-fiction-no-21-ernest-hemingway"&gt;sharpened pencils&lt;/a&gt; before he started writing; Charles Dickens arranged trinkets on his desk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a catalyst, it is so easy to procrastinate because nothing acts as a &amp;#8220;signal" that you&amp;#8217;re going to start working. You&amp;#8217;re stuck, trying to drive uphill when you haven&amp;#8217;t even started the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My catalyst is preparing a cup of tea. Because there are several steps—heating the water, select the tea, scooping and packing the loose tea into a tea ball, pouring the water over the tea, and watching as it steeps—it becomes a short ritual that I carry out with my full attention. I can then sit down and, say, write this article. &lt;span&gt;Maybe yours is &lt;a href="http://www.happiness-project.com/happiness_project/2012/08/no-time-for-something-important-to-you-try-getting-up-earlier/"&gt;waking up early&lt;/a&gt;, preparing morning coffee, taking a shower, &lt;a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/aug/16/news/la-heb-15-minutes-exercise-health-benefit-20110816"&gt;doing 15 minutes of exercise&lt;/a&gt; or stretching, or even just commuting to work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t let yourself procrastinate: find your productivity catalyst.&lt;/strong&gt; It is one of the most important tools you&amp;#8217;ll ever acquire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/43498375726</link><guid>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/43498375726</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 Feb 2013 13:38:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>Minimum Viable Workstation</title><description>&lt;p&gt;As a freelancer, I frequently find myself working in of a lot of different places, from coffee shops to beaches. This means that I need a fairly flexible workstation: good for home, but easily carried and used in other venues. When I first started out, I had a full workstation: 15" MacBook Pro, a separate monitor, mouse, and keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I switched to a 13" MacBook Air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while, I got rid of the monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And ever since, I&amp;#8217;ve just toted around the Air as my entire workstation—but is it possible to work with less? What is it that prevents us, as designers and developers, from working on a smaller device?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not the lack of services:&lt;span&gt; TypeKit, GitHub, Basecamp, Harvest, Pivotal/Lighthouse all make project management easy. It&amp;#8217;s not the lack of hardware: between iPads, iPhones, Android tablets, and Bluetooth keyboards, we&amp;#8217;re pretty well covered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think screen space is the biggest impediment, either. Rather, the real stopper is the software that has stubbornly stayed &amp;#8220;desktop only": our coding and design environments. After so many years, we have not yet solved the problem of editing and reviewing Photoshop/Illustrator/Fireworks files on a mobile device, nor adequately built a mobile coding environment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Perhaps we need to perfect the remote machine/local UI hybrid. Perhaps there is another, better solution. All I know is, I&amp;#8217;d eventually like my workstation to fit in my jacket pocket.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/41454520342</link><guid>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/41454520342</guid><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jan 2013 14:00:28 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>The Technology Problem</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had a long conversation with a non-Valley entrepreneur that just raised a significant amount of money from Valley angels. During our conversation, he brought up a very interesting point: Valley investors and entrepreneurs are singularly focused on the &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mcclure-food-tech-market-opportunity-is-huge-2012-12"&gt;"apply technology and stir"&lt;/a&gt; model of business-building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Valley investors think you can throw enough smart developers at a problem to get it solved. Valley entrepreneurs see a problem and want to solve it with development: the best tool they have at hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our hurry to simplify, commodify, and &amp;#8220;scale" every experience, it feels as though we have lost sight of what ultimately creates many experiences: the human element. &lt;a href="http://elacarte.com"&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://support.google.com/?hl=en"&gt;time again&lt;/a&gt; we insist on leaving human interaction behind, to be replaced with screens, buttons, and automated responses to our problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you step outside that thought bubble for just a moment, you begin to discover that most people use technology as its intended to be used: a supplement to their experiences and day-to-day, rather than a replacement. Even with a map in their pocket, most people will still verbally debate the directions to a place rather than look it up. Instead of booking a reservation for a restaurant online, most people still happily call the restaurant and do the process over the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot adequately imitate the warmth of a person&amp;#8217;s voice, the feeling of a personalized experience, or the benefit of someone truly understanding what you want by simply applying some technology and stirring thoroughly. There&amp;#8217;s nothing quite like the &lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/"&gt;intersection of technology and human interaction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some experiences &lt;span&gt;absolutely&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; benefit from increased efficiency and the application of smart technology, but the lack of thoughtful discretion can often be frightening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the old saying goes, &lt;em&gt;"when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/39172869001</link><guid>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/39172869001</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Dec 2012 20:18:04 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>The Plateau of Unhappiness</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while, something I&amp;#8217;m working on doesn&amp;#8217;t pan out as expected. Whether it&amp;#8217;s a rejection to a project, a dud of a design or just a particularly slow week, I&amp;#8217;ll have an unusually negative reaction that echoes through me. I begin feeling stagnant, as though I&amp;#8217;m not working hard enough or the work I am doing is simply not good enough, regardless of actual effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call this the &lt;strong&gt;Plateau of Unhappiness&lt;/strong&gt;. You fear that you&amp;#8217;re no closer to your goals than when you began; no progress has been made. And now, you&amp;#8217;ve hit this point where your efforts—no matter how much you may put in—seem to no longer have you on an upward trajectory. You&amp;#8217;re stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But, the fact is, the Plateau is an illusion. A trick your mind plays out of fear and the result of a negative experience. Humans &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias"&gt;unwittingly give more weight to negative experiences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (like a rejection) and, in the moment, they can color our view of prior experiences and successes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t let it fool you: a slow week, a rejection, a lack of reply won&amp;#8217;t set you back. As long as you&amp;#8217;re always making progress towards your goal, the trajectory is still upwards. &lt;span&gt;You&amp;#8217;re not stuck, your efforts have not landed you in a rut. Push forth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/37907810266</link><guid>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/37907810266</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Dec 2012 09:32:59 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>Craft</title><description>&lt;p&gt;"A master of his craft." A phrase often uttered but apparently little understood—or, at least, little appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is often associated negatively—things can seem &amp;#8220;too crafty"—or sheerly as the mundane steps from concept to creation. But it is much more than that. It is the deep knowledge of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; something is done in such a way. It is the art of perfection through understanding. It is &lt;a href="http://dcurt.is/the-best"&gt;the best&lt;/a&gt; knife for a particular purpose. It is the relentless obsession with learning, iterating, and improving without forgiveness for others. It is the desire to create something unequalled for its purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Photo from sumpcoffee.com" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdnxn93c4Z1qejj3z.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently visited a coffee shop called &lt;a href="http://www.sumpcoffee.com/about"&gt;Sump Coffee&lt;/a&gt;. Their mission statement, taken directly from their website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary pursuit at Sump is the perfect handcrafted cup of coffee –regardless of the brewing method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I entered the café, located in a quiet St. Louis neighborhood, I was reminded of what it means to be truly obsessed with your craft. While busy, it was quiet—like a hallowed wooden hall designed for one purpose and one purpose alone: to create the perfect coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott, the proprietor, spends an extensive amount of time trying new methods, tools, beans—anything that he thinks with drive him in the right direction. However, as you sit in the café, you can tell that this is not something done in a hurry. He is in no rush. Each day is a step forward, but the goal is not getting further away. The perfect cup of coffee is a &lt;em&gt;pursuit&lt;/em&gt;, whether or not it is acheivable is beyond the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sump even admits this themselves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now can we guarantee that you will find no equal to our coffee? No. Each palate is different and comes with its own context and history. Neither do I know that we will find this ‘grail’ or that it is something other than myth –like a unicorn or chupacabra. But, most of the interesting stuff in life happens in the doing, in the questing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, to many, this obsession feels like a form of consumerism. An unnecessary obession over a singular product. As a society, we settle for &amp;#8220;okay" and &amp;#8220;good enough." Our stores stocked with cheaply built and poorly-designed wares and temporary solutions to problems—both ongoing and temporary. As developers and entrepreneurs, we &amp;#8220;move fast," &amp;#8220;break things," &amp;#8220;iterate," &amp;#8220;pivot."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But this is not craft. This is &amp;#8220;good enough." Craft is a balance of the act of creation, interluded gracefully with pauses for consideration, learning, experimentation, and discovery. More often than not, it feels as though these interludes are considered a loss of steam or a step in the wrong direction. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Good enough is, well, good enough. It solves the problem. But let&amp;#8217;s not forget that it&amp;#8217;s okay to obsess. Pursue perfection, even if it seems unachievable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/35958973262</link><guid>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/35958973262</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Nov 2012 22:18:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><title>The Problem With TL;DR</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;TL;DR: Too Long; Didn&amp;#8217;t Read.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It seems that, recently, many people are trying to simplify the act of news consumption. Faster ways to read, shorter summaries, aggregation of updates and rolling together similar content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But here&amp;#8217;s the kicker: we really don’t care about the majority of the news out there. It&amp;#8217;s not that we lack the time to consume this information or that we feel overwhelmed by the volume or length of it. &lt;em&gt;We just do not care.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is important to know what is going on in the world around you. But to know every detail, every update, every little thing that happens? No. If I desire that kind of depth, I&amp;#8217;ll seek out that information independently—it doesn’t need to be delivered to me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, interest discovery and personalization are difficult topics and we have yet to completely crack that nut. However, the focus on speed and efficiency &lt;em&gt;is not&lt;/em&gt; a good interim approach until we solve that problem better. &lt;span&gt;News is an endless consumable; there&amp;#8217;s always more to be read, endlessly produced. Making it more efficent solves a problem on the wrong side of the equation: how can the journalists get readers more information, more quickly?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the other side, however, the question really boils down to: where can I read content that interests me, the reader, and avoid the cruft?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Information isn&amp;#8217;t consumed by quantity but by interest.&lt;/strong&gt; We really don&amp;#8217;t need to read more, faster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/34849096021</link><guid>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/34849096021</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Nov 2012 16:38:29 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>Manifesto</title><description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of undue focus in startups about finding &lt;em&gt;the idea&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;the problem. &lt;/em&gt;As Dave McClure put it, you want to be solving a problem that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davemcclure/status/259653387761631233"&gt;“bothers u so much u can’t sleep, can’t take time to PEE.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This focus on the problem makes sense: it’s concrete and results in a tangible solution. &lt;span&gt;However, I don’t think it’s quite that simple for many—if not most—people. It’s not a singular idea or problem that drives people and gives them their determination. It’s an underlying goal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is where many individuals flounder: what are you trying to, ultimately, achieve? Do you want to simplify banking? Make someone’s day brighter? Help people travel hassle-free?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are goals. These define a problem space. Once you’re thinking within a specific problem space, it’s easy to find lots of potentially solvable problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where a manifesto comes in: it helps hone in on that problem space. Everyone should have a personal manifesto outlining your aims, your goals, what you ultimately desire to achieve. This is what will drive you, your startup, and your passion—not the individual problem or idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your manifesto can be a bulleted list of items, or a simple statment of purpose. To lack one, however, leaves you adrift in an endless space of solvable problems you may or may not be passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s my manifesto? The short of it: &lt;span&gt;I want to increase the signal and reduce the noise in people’s daily lives and create tools that help people do so.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/34066181522</link><guid>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/34066181522</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Oct 2012 20:18:20 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>The Weight of Remembering</title><description>&lt;p&gt;You schedule meetings and events on your calendar. You put discernable tasks on your todo list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about all the things you&amp;#8217;d like to remember that don&amp;#8217;t quite fit either category? Those articles you&amp;#8217;d like to read when you have a free moment, that activity you&amp;#8217;d like to turn into a habit, that person you need to touch base with again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remembering all of these incidental activities has become a weight we all carry. I want to respond to my email backlog, remember to track my habits on &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lift/id530911645?mt=8"&gt;Lift&lt;/a&gt;, check-in on Foursquare, come back to my saved content in Instapaper/&lt;a href="http://getpocket.com"&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, all of these services do nothing to remind me and let me build a habit—they just add more weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need tools that will allow us to schedule reminders for—or automate—these incidental activities. Most of us aren&amp;#8217;t steel traps, remembering every little thing we&amp;#8217;d like to do, nor so utterly excited to use every service that we&amp;#8217;ll remember to use it. Not only that but, without building habits, it is very easy to forget and fall back to old habits and base behaviors—only to later (inconveniently) remember that we have these other things to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://bufferapp.com"&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt; is a great example of a step in the right direction. While not great for actively engaging in conversations, it allows you to tweet at a regulated pace. Tweeting can be thought of as both a time and content based activity—you often don&amp;#8217;t want to tweet several things in a row lest you annoy your followers. Buffer allows you to automate the time part of the equation, leaving you to only worry about content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#8217;s no longer about just providing us with the tools to do something but also providing us with the tools to alleviate a burden.&lt;/strong&gt; We want to remember to do these incidental activities and not feel a weight to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/31699794775</link><guid>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/31699794775</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2012 20:58:29 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>Nothing is Quite What it Seems</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Photos from my friend&amp;#8217;s recent trip to San Francisco just popped up in my Facebook stream. Another friend just checked in at a warehouse party. Meanwhile, my Japanese friend just uploaded group photos from a costume party. My Twitter feed is overflowing with check-ins, announcements of late night work stints, and self-congratulatory &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23humblebrag"&gt;#humblebrags&lt;/a&gt; about who they are hanging out with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Context is everything. In this world of constant communication, it&amp;#8217;s easy to feel as though everyone else&amp;#8217;s life is amazing, while you&amp;#8217;re still sitting there eating cereal in your underwear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of your 2,000 Facebook friends* and 300 people you follow on Twitter, it&amp;#8217;s inevitable that some small percentage are doing something interesting at any given moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at it the other way around, though, the vast majority of people are sitting around wondering why they seem boring, just like you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startup culture promotes this mentality to &amp;#8220;Always Be Interesting." Interesting people are always doing something, meeting someone, or partying. When they&amp;#8217;re not, they&amp;#8217;re working 18 hour days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mentality is perpetuated by our drive, as a community and culture, to be more and more &amp;#8220;social" — the more we can communicate, the more often we can remind people we&amp;#8217;re interesting and you need to pay attention to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These 18 hour days involve 10 hours of goofing around at the office. These parties never as thrilling as they seem to be from the outside. These meetings are interesting, but let&amp;#8217;s keep our egos in check. I&amp;#8217;ve seen it from all sides, I&amp;#8217;m familiar with the need to inflate the importance of an event, and I know how it feels to wonder why everyone else is doing something interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t play into it: nothing is quite as it seems to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(* hopefully an exaggeration)&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/31170623385</link><guid>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/31170623385</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Sep 2012 22:55:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>The Future is not Real-Time</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Many technology pundits have insisted that the future is in real-time communication. You will know about everything going on in the world, instantly—&lt;em&gt;bzzt&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;you have a new push notification.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a daily basis, we&amp;#8217;re exposed to hundreds of articles, tweets, emails and advertisements. We are, as some put it, an &amp;#8220;overcommunicated" society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quote from an email a friend sent me recently,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re exposed to more content than at any time in our lives yet the amount of time to consume it isn&amp;#8217;t increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only so many waking hours in the day, and even fewer of those can be dedicated to consuming the world of content. Worse yet, filtering the wheat from the chaff has become an even more strenuous activity—efforts such as &lt;a href="http://inboxzero.com/"&gt;Inbox Zero&lt;/a&gt; reflect this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of this content vying for our attention at virtually &lt;a href="http://pewresearch.org/databank/dailynumber/?NumberID=1090"&gt;every hour of the day&lt;/a&gt;, I believe &lt;strong&gt;the future is not real-time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Instead, we will find ways to artificially stem the constant flow of information through algorithmic summarization. We will find ways to bring information we are truly interested in back to us at a pace and time that is more manageable. Instant notifications will be reserved for those few precious individuals and apps that &lt;em&gt;absolutely need&lt;/em&gt; our attention, rather than those that simply want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are already small efforts to make this happen. Look at the recent addition of Twitter&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/14/twitter-email-digest/"&gt;weekly digest&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook&amp;#8217;s relatively recent switch to a &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2011/09/22/140719984/the-new-top-story-facebook-s-flow-of-change"&gt;Top News&lt;/a&gt; feed, or—my personal favorite—&lt;a href="http://blog.jackcheng.com/post/25160553986/the-slow-web"&gt;The Slow Web Movement&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#8217;re at the very forefront of this trend and our understanding of how to coalesce all of this information into valuable, individually relevant, and timely packages is still in its infancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real-time web is a bit like a fire hydrant—either the valve is opened or closed, but there&amp;#8217;s no filter to stem the flow; we become the filter for the massive flow of information. &lt;strong&gt;Content should always feel like&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;a gift, not a burden. &lt;/strong&gt;To turn it into a gift, we need to start focusing on ways to control the flow.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/29796275100</link><guid>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/29796275100</guid><pubDate>Sun, 19 Aug 2012 21:18:47 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>The "Work" Trap</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I find that I—as well as many people I know—fall into a very dangerous trap. I call it &lt;strong&gt;The &amp;#8220;Work" Trap&lt;/strong&gt;. What is it? It&amp;#8217;s both a procrastination technique and a way of staying in your comfort zone while feeling or seeming productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You fall into the trap when you forgo other, perhaps beneficial, activities because you have &amp;#8220;too much work to do." You turn down a coffee with someone new, avoid going to an interesting meetup, or put off replying to (or initiating) important emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many times have you made that excuse? How many more times have you made that excuse, then failed to even actually do any work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many people, &amp;#8220;doing work" is easy in comparison to these activities: it&amp;#8217;s known, familiar, expected, and the best part is that it&amp;#8217;s also time consuming and &amp;#8220;productive." In reality, doing these things could be equally—if not more—beneficial than just attempting to get more work done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not going to make a bulleted five-point list of things you can do to avoid this trap—everyone justifies it differently. Just recognize when you&amp;#8217;re falling into the trap out of comfort, as opposed to a true, driving need to get something done.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/29050677758</link><guid>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/29050677758</guid><pubDate>Thu, 09 Aug 2012 09:12:41 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>Your Unique Value Proposition is not your marketing angle.</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Every startup these days has a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_value_proposition"&gt;Unique Value Proposition&lt;/a&gt;. Investors want to know what it is, startup blogs pontificate on the best wording of it. It&amp;#8217;s widely regarded as one of the most important ways to pitch and sell your startup. And this is true—if your only customers are VCs and angel investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;it should not be your marketing angle.&lt;/strong&gt; With over &lt;a href="http://web.sba.gov/faqs/faqindex.cfm?areaID=24"&gt;half a million new businesses&lt;/a&gt; being born yearly and the internet creating an ever-expanding reach, your &amp;#8220;unique value" just doesn&amp;#8217;t cut it for consumers anymore. This is far and away one of the biggest mistakes I see tech startups make on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example: &lt;a href="http://flightfox.com/"&gt;FlightFox&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;em&gt;Real people compete to find you the best flights. &lt;/em&gt;This certainly tells an investor exactly what FlightFox does, but to the consumer it&amp;#8217;s primarily the same old noise. People aren&amp;#8217;t sold on the &amp;#8220;best," &amp;#8220;simplest," &amp;#8220;fastest," or &amp;#8220;easiest."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other examples of Unique Value Propositions used in marketing a startup&amp;#8217;s product:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://filepicker.io"&gt;Filepicker.io&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;em&gt;Simplify User Content Handling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://amicushq.com"&gt;Amicus&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;em&gt;Amicus empowers cause-driven organizations to leverage the social networks of their supporters, raise more money, attract more members, and win more votes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://sponsorfied.com"&gt;Sponsorfied&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;em&gt;We simplify sponsorships by connecting the best brands with amazing opportunities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Startups need to start saving their Unique Value Proposition for the about page and start &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning_(marketing)"&gt;positioning&lt;/a&gt; themselves. Get into my head, create an identity for yourself, and find a way to stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, what about a good example? &lt;a href="https://squareup.com/"&gt;Square&lt;/a&gt; does it right: &lt;em&gt;Start accepting credit cards today.&lt;/em&gt; Anyone who is looking to accept credit cards for their business knows just how annoying the process can be. Those five words tell me all I care about: I can accept credit cards, today—implying that the process will also be simple. Square doesn&amp;#8217;t need to tell me outright how &amp;#8220;simple" and &amp;#8220;easy" it is to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line: Shock me. Surprise me. Tell me, simply, how your startup benefits me. Tell me why your competition sucks. But don&amp;#8217;t expect to sell me by merely telling me what you do.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/28761837073</link><guid>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/28761837073</guid><pubDate>Sun, 05 Aug 2012 08:22:23 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>The 6,000 Year Trip</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Something in the travel industry is horribly broken: &lt;a href="ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/common/ssi/ecm/en/gbe03445usen/GBE03445USEN.PDF"&gt;45% of all travelers&lt;/a&gt; (business and leisure) spend more than two hours researching and booking travel online. Last year, &lt;a href="http://tinet.ita.doc.gov/outreachpages/download_data_table/2011_US_Travel_Abroad.pdf"&gt;58,702,000 U.S. residents&lt;/a&gt; traveled internationally, which means that &lt;strong&gt;well o&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ver 6,000 man-years&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;52,831,800 hours&lt;/strong&gt; were spent &lt;em&gt;just &lt;/em&gt;researching and booking travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;According to a 2010 survey of over 1,000 global travelers, four of the top eight words most associated with travel were negative – such as “frustrating,” “unreliable,” “infuriating” and “broken.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;— &lt;a href="ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/common/ssi/ecm/en/gbe03445usen/GBE03445USEN.PDF"&gt;Travel 2020: The distribution dilemma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;With that much time being devoted to planning a trip and not actually traveling, I can understand why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/27783234694</link><guid>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/27783234694</guid><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jul 2012 16:56:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>Confusing Controls</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently took an American Airlines flight from New York&amp;#8217;s JFK to San Francisco. While I&amp;#8217;m usually quite occupied with my laptop, I caught a glimpse of what movie was playing and decided I&amp;#8217;d like to watch for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I went to plug my headphones in, the armrest controls presented me with this stunningly bad example of an interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Panel on an American Airlines flight" height="314" src="http://cl.ly/3S0G1C2K1Y1F0l2p1i3o/airplane_ctrl_panel.png" width="400"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at that panel for a moment. What controls the volume? The channel? Which toggle turns on the light, or calls the flight attendant?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine looking at that panel from above, in a seat that is perhaps 2 - 4" wider than your own body. All of these controls look symmetrical, similar, and the bottom two items feel roughly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the panel, labeled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="314" src="http://cl.ly/0Z3X1J3G0P1E1n3I0s0v/airplane_ctrl_panel_labeled.png" width="400"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headphone jack is on the opposite side from the volume controls. The light icon is actually a button—but the flight attendant icon is just a sticker! Instead, the attendant button is right below the volume controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entire control panel is a very good example of an ambiguous interface. The same paradigm is used for completely different purposes, and completely unrelated functions are not grouped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great example of how &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to design a UI.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/24683064677</link><guid>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/24683064677</guid><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jun 2012 11:56:01 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>Plagiarism</title><description>&lt;p&gt;As we were all taught in grade school and college, plagiarism isn&amp;#8217;t okay. Even worse is attempting to defend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I wrote a short article about &lt;a href="http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/22958656041/the-144-146-165-button"&gt;The $144,146,165 Button&lt;/a&gt;. I did the research via several sources, compiling it together to produce this interesting statistic. It was on the front page of Hacker News for most of Sunday, tweeted and re-tweeted by many people. I&amp;#8217;m incredibly happy to have written something people are so interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/shareables/2012/05/14/how-3-simple-buttons-raised-tipping-by-144-million-in-nyc-cabs/"&gt;TheNextWeb&lt;/a&gt; took a little bit of that away from me by basically &lt;a href="http://cl.ly/1a0c2y2p291H1u2T2s3S"&gt;plagiarizing my post&lt;/a&gt; (pic), being sneaky about it, and defending it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll notice in the linked image, they say &amp;#8220;Here’s what one Joshua Gross found" before the marginally altered paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is what the original post looked like when it first hit their front page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://cl.ly/0q1C3n1j323R3C131X0d/o"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cl.ly/0c46022C3m3f2i3a152y/Image%202012.05.14%202:49:46%20PM.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Click to expand to a full page screenshot).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, here are the relevant paragraphs from my post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cl.ly/0h2z001s3e2F2J3y3w3b/Image%202012.05.14%201:53:53%20PM.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only did they not credit my content in the original post, but the second sentence of the first paragraph is taken nearly word-for-word, as is most of the second paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TheNextWeb editors quickly and quietly changed the wording and added a credit. Just minutes before they updated it, I had tweeted this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cl.ly/0r2l0E0j1s3r3j3l0y0Y/Image%202012.05.14%203:30:58%20PM.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After changing the article without letting me know, the CEO then tweeted back at me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cl.ly/2Y1O0f2D1S3i0E2N1C43/Image%202012.05.14%202:21:12%20PM.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zee is the CEO of TheNextWeb, blatantly defending plagiarism and playing games to cover it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only was this handled poorly, it is downright wrong. If they had just owned up to their mistake, then it might not have been a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/23049725899</link><guid>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/23049725899</guid><pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2012 15:07:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><title>The $144,146,165 Button</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The average New York City taxi cab driver makes &lt;a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/downloads/pdf/presentation.pdf"&gt;$90,747 in revenue per year&lt;/a&gt;. There are roughly &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Taxi#cite_note-1"&gt;13,267 cabs&lt;/a&gt; in the city. In 2007, NYC forced cab drivers to begin taking credit cards, which involved installing a touch screen system for payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During payment, the user is presented with three default buttons for tipping: 20%, 25%, and 30%. When cabs were cash only, the average tip was roughly 10%. After the introduction of this system, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/nyregion/08taxi.html"&gt;the tip percentage jumped to 22%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, yes. I could have. However, I deliberately chose not to. We spend so much of our lives convinced just how important the internet is. We need it to navigate, to find food, to share our lives and consume others&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I wanted to try an experiment: &lt;em&gt;build a web app that relies upon the internet in every facet of its existence without using the internet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to build Hopper during a week-long vacation on &lt;a href="http://g.co/maps/t4af5" title="Map of Singer Island"&gt;Singer Island&lt;/a&gt;. I worked in the evenings on the darkened balcony of my hotel room. Light from a small reading lamp lazily floated through the curtains behind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was disconnected. Without the noise of instant messengers, tweets, emails, nor the beckoning delight of social news and entertaining distractions available to me, I was completely focused on building Hopper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week prior to that first line of code, I was planning the project. I knew I was going to build it without internet and had to make some decisions. What tools would I need? What documentation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being without internet forces you to focus on the essentials. With the vastness of its offerings and near interminable variety of choices, it&amp;#8217;s all too easy to get caught up in trying this, that, and the other thing. You lose focus on the point: what is absolutely necessary for me to get this done? Knowing I was going to be without internet drove me to make quick, decisive choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded the scant few libraries I would need to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days in and the project was coming along great. Most of the components were either completed or at least had a skeleton to build upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I hit a roadblock: I hadn&amp;#8217;t foreseen the need for one small but pivotal library. &amp;#8220;Crap," I said aloud, &amp;#8220;this is a problem."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled out my phone to research my options. I quickly found a two hundred line library that covered my needs—but I had no way to transfer it from my phone to my laptop. So, I buckled down and copied it off my phone, manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty minutes later, I had a carbon copy of the library in my project. Better yet, I now had an understanding of the library—I knew exactly how the algorithm worked because I was forced to read it as I rewrote it. Had I been connected to the internet, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have given two thoughts to downloading it and dropping it into the project, sight nearly unseen, let alone understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet is a tool, and like any tool, it can be abused. We use it at inappropriate times or when can get by without it, without a second thought. Thanks to its multi-purpose nature, it slips into the many crevices of our lives without much notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took notice and chose to do away with it during what many would consider an appropriate or, even, necessary time to use it. I wanted to prove it was not only possible and doable, but a successful, viable, and &lt;em&gt;repeatable&lt;/em&gt; activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopper, today, has over 10,000 users and 70,000 pastes. I continue to regularly disconnect completely while doing development and design. I&amp;#8217;d consider that successful, viable, and repeatable—wouldn&amp;#8217;t you?&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/22325833009</link><guid>http://notes.unwieldy.net/post/22325833009</guid><pubDate>Thu, 03 May 2012 12:54:00 -0400</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
