  It’s third-and-2 and you desperately need a first down. What do you do, run or pass?
</p>
<p>
  A few months ago, <a href="http://www.advancednflstats.com/" target="_blank">Advanced NFL Stats</a> released <a href="http://www.advancednflstats.com/2010/04/play-by-play-data.html" target="_blank">an
  incredible dataset</a> containing information on every play of the 2012 NFL regular season. We structured that dataset and
  <a href="https://www.statwing.com/open/datasets/a5f1490426a4715847054a3e72f09dde28edaf21#workspaces/1697" target="_blank">
  uploaded it into Statwing for analysis.</a><sup><a class="endnote-top"></a></sup>
  Now you can test your coaching instincts against the data.

      <p>
        About 1.5% of field goal attempts are unsuccessful at that range, so you’re virtually assured three points if you kick.<sup><a class="endnote-top"></a></sup>
        When teams go for it on fourth-and-goal from the 2, they get a touchdown 44% of the time.<sup><a class="endnote-top"></a></sup>
        So on average teams get 3.1 points when they go for it&mdash;roughly the same amount they&#8217;d expect if they kicked a field goal.

        But that&#8217;s not all. If you&#8217;re stopped on fourth-and-goal, the opponent starts with terrible field position. You&#8217;ll even get a safety about 5% of the time.
        By comparison, you can expect the opponent to start from the 23-yard line after a kickoff following a made field goal,
        and they will even have a 0.5% chance of returning the kickoff for a touchdown

        Going for it and kicking a field goal both yield about 3 points on average, and the field position is much better if you go for it.
        Despite this, coaches usually kick a field goal on fourth-and-goal.
        In fact, during the last ten seasons coaches only went for the touchdown <em>twice</em> in this situation.

        During the last ten years running has succeeded 61% of the time, versus 45% for passing.
      </p>
      <p>
        This seems odd because we just found out that running wasn&#8217;t better than passing on third-and-2.
        But the two-point conversion situation is different from a typical third-and-2.
        For example, the defense isn’t spread out, so it’s hard for receivers to find gaps in the coverage.

    <a class="endnote-bottom"></a>
    The <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/statwing.com/file/d/0BxEXxf9odCnMOGdHRUVvOV9GVVk/edit" target="_blank">original data</a> from
    <a href="http://www.advancednflstats.com/" target="_blank">Advanced NFL Stats</a> is mostly free-text play descriptions,
    which we interpreted into structured data using Excel.
    The original data does have a few errors here and there, not all of which could be cleaned up.
    Some plays are missing, and a very small number of plays have some inaccurate data.
    But overall the dataset is comprehensive and accurate.
    For example, the dataset only omits four of the roughly 1,000 field goals attempted in 2012.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can download the structured data in Excel to see the specifics of how we calculated various fields from the original data:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://blog.statwing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2012-NFL-Season-Final.xlsx">2012 regular season data</a> (39MB).
        This data is excellent, though not perfect.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/286jayvtj4mginx/2003-2012%20NFL%20Seasons%20-%20All%20Data.xlsx">All data from 2003&ndash;2012</a> except the 2012 playoffs (101MB).
        Our formulas are only tailored to the 2012 season, so there are a few difficulties when applying our formulas to the multi-year dataset.
        For example, the older dataset doesn&#8217;t always distinguish quarterback scrambles from run plays.
        Still, the data for the other seasons seems similar in most respects.</li>
      <li><a href="http://blog.statwing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2003-2012-NFL-Seasons-2-point-attempts.xlsx">Two-point conversions</a> (200kB).
        A subset of the 2003&ndash;2012 dataset. It contains every two-point conversion during that time frame.</li>
      <li><a href="http://blog.statwing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2003-2012-NFL-Seasons-3-4-and-goal.xlsx">Third- or fourth-and-goal</a> (4MB).
        A subset of the 2003&ndash;2012 dataset. It contains every third- or fourth-and-goal from inside the 10-yard line during that time frame.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    <a class="endnote-bottom"></a>
    We make the following assumptions throughout:
    <ul>
      <li>You are coaching the “average” team. Individual teams would vary, but the data we use is the average of all teams’ behaviors in whatever situation we are analyzing. </li>
      <li>There are more than five minutes left in the half or game. Last minute plays have slightly different outcomes, so we exclude them.</li>
      <li>Yardage from penalties committed during a play is included in the outcome.</li>
      <li>The hypothetical coach does not always call the same type of play in the same situation.
        That is, the coach randomizes play calling enough to be unpredictable while still favoring the more advantageous plays.
        The very awesome Brian at Advanced NFL Stats does a great job of
        <a href="http://www.advancednflstats.com/2008/06/game-theory-and-runpass-balance.html" target="_blank">describing randomization and game theory</a>.
    </ul>

    to see the analysis that yielded the 1.5% number.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a class="endnote-bottom"></a>
    In the last ten years, there have only been twenty-five instances where teams went for it on fourth-and-goal at the 2-yard line. It turns out, though, that going for the end
    zone on third-and-short is pretty similarly successful to going for it on fourth-and-short, so we used both types of plays in this analysis. For example, the 44% figure
    was calculated using both third- and fourth-and-2. Here, as with the rest of this fourth-and-2 analysis, we were inspired by a
    <a href="http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~dromer/papers/JPE_April06.pdf" target="_blank">2002 paper by David Romer</a>. Romer is a notable Berkeley economist, and
    his wife chaired the White House Council of Economic Advisors in 2009 and 2010.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a class="endnote-bottom"></a>
    This was barely statistically significant in the 2012 dataset,
    so we ran the same analysis in the 2003&ndash;2012 dataset. There we found a very clearly statistically significant relationship.
    The magnitude of the difference between the two running directions was only 6.5% in the ten-year dataset,
    as opposed to 11% (with wide confidence intervals) in the 2012 dataset.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a class="endnote-bottom"></a>
    If objectives other than just picking up a first down are considered, there is actually some evidence that running is better. Brian at Advanced NFL Stats
    does a <a href="http://www.advancednflstats.com/2009/12/run-pass-imbalance-on-2nd-and-3rd-downs.html" target="_blank">great job of diving into that question</a>,
    though you might want to learn about the concept of
    <a href="http://www.advancednflstats.com/2010/01/expected-points-ep-and-expected-points.html" target="blank">expected points</a> before reading Brian&#8217;s analysis.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a class="endnote-bottom"></a>
    Brian at Advanced NFL Stats <a href="http://www.advancednflstats.com/2008/08/play-calling-on-3rd-and-short-part-1.html" target="_blank">looked at this same question</a>
    with data from 2000 to 2007. He found that running was more likely to have resulted in a first down on third-and-2.
    He brought more data to bear, but our confidence intervals were pretty narrow. This suggests that in 2012 running and passing were
    more similar in their success on third-and-2 than during the years Brian looked at.
